## HGA Mission Statement ##

The mission of Heartland Greyhound Adoption is: to educate the public about greyhounds through outreach projects; to encourage and nurture the adoption of greyhounds; to accept and screen applications for greyhound adoption; to establish foster homes for greyhounds prior to adoption; to aid and support the efforts of other greyhound friends and adoption groups; to establish and promote cooperation and understanding with local humane societies and other animal-interest groups.

## Group History ##

One Sunday afternoon in September 2000, three greyhounds and their owners gathered for a “Meet-And- Greet” at the PETCO Store on Buffalo Rd. in Clive, IA. In June 2001, Heartland Greyhound Adoption was formally established as a volunteer, not-for- profit organization. Currently Heartland Greyhound Adoption has over 200 members in the Midwest. These members form a network of volunteers and foster homes that allow our organization to transition racing greyhounds into retirement. HGA has over 1,300 happy tails!
