Title Winner aka Winny has adjusted to life off the track very well despite his injuries. He will be 4 years old in July. Â Winny came off the track with a broken leg, had surgery and will be in a cast until about mid-June. Winny gets around very well with his cast though we have not been able to try stairs. He does okay on the hardwood floors.Â  Winny gets along with his house mates-a cat, small dog and another greyhound.Â  He kennels well and is great on a leash. Winny is potty trained and has had no accidents in the house.Â  He is a very calm boy who loves attention and to lay on his bed.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Winny at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
