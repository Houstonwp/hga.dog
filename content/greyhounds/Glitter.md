This is Glitter, an 8 year old red fawn female with a cropped tail.  She has been a mom to several pups and is ready for retirement!  Glitter is currently healing from a broken rear hock.  She seems to have very calm mannerisms and tested OK with small animals. 


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Glitter at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.



The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
