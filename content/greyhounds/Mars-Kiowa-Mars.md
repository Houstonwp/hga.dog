Mars (Kiowa Mars) is a handsome, speckled young boy who will turn 2 at the end of October. He's currently living with another greyhound and two other large dogs, and getting along well with them all. 

Mars likes toys, but he is best with those that don't have squeakers, he is determined to destroy the squeak!

Mars is adventurous, outgoing, and friendly. He is great on leash, and love meeting people.

Mars has tested as possibly workable with cats. He was very excited in the presence of the cat, and did bark at it, but he was very easily distracted from the cat, and would listen to corrections. If he is to be placed in a home with cats careful introductions will be necessary, and he will have to be taught to leave cats alone. Mars is still basically a puppy, so may annoy and want to chase cats, his behavior looked much more like puppy excitement than predatory, but due to his size and play style he would have to be discouraged from thinking of cats as objects or companions for play.

We'll update with more information as we get to know him better - 9/6/16

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
