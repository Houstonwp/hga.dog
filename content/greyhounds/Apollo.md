 "JR's Apollo" is pretty much perfect. This sweet 9 year old guy is laid back, has great manners and is a love bug to boot. He can be trusted loose in the house while you are gone, he walks well on a leash, he doesn't counter surf, beg, bark or get on the furniture. He would be a great first-time greyhound. He does well around all the dogs he has met, and would do fine with canine siblings or as an only dog. He would do better in a home without kitties though. Apollo likes to lay on his bed and watch everything. He is affectionate without being needy and he does not get underfoot. 
 
Apollo is so cute when you give him a treat, he takes it to his bed where he bites off little pieces and eats them slowly. He really savors his food. He loves to have his ears and neck scratched and makes the happiest moaning sounds to show his appreciation. When he is excited or suprised his ears go way up and meet over his head in a triangle. He also has great 'airplane ears.' 



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Apollo at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
