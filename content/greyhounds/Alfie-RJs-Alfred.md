Alfie is 4 1/2 years old and is settling in fine with a small dog and kids! We'll have more info on him soon.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
