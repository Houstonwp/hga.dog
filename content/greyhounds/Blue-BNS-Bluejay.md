This is BNS Bluejay. She is 9 1/2 years old and has just retired as a momma dog. She is a big girl weighing 80 pounds. She has tested well with the kitty. Blue's foster family says she is just the sweetest thing! She loves to run around the yard and go for walks. She plays with toys and will almost fetch. Sometimes. She nits when happy & excited. Blue loves to hang out with the other dogs in the house and may do best with another dog. She is being fostered in Cedar Rapids. 

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $200. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
