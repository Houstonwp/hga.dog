Sunny is a year and a half old female!  She is a cute little thing.  She LOVES to play with toys and is always in the middle of the action.  She would do well in a single dog home or with another dog.  She seems to be interested in what ever kids are doing.  She is housebroken and is learning the retired life pretty quickly.  She would have to be tested with each home's small animals.  She is not cat friendly at this point, however, she does live with a small dog.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Sunny at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
