Meet Blaze (aka BK Kickin Back at the track)! He is 4 Â½ years old (born 8/1/08) with a beautiful sleek black coat. He loves being around people and is currently living with another greyhound. Blaze is a real love bug, according to his foster dad - he seems to have a real need to be close to his people. He would be a perfect companion for somebody who is home most of the time and wants a close buddy.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Blaze at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
