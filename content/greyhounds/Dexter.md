Dexter is a great dog and has been in our family for about five years.  He is Dexter is a 7 year old wonderful boy. Dexter is a very loyal boy. He loves his family and would never want to leave you. Dexter has been around other dogs big and small and get along  nicely with them. Dexter has been around kids most of his life.
Something's Dexter enjoys are his soft cozy bed, people, a nice fenced yard, walks, and a good a scratch behind his ears. There are a few things he doesn't seem to care for. Cats, fireworks, and since he's gotten older car rides but once you get going he settles down nicely. Another thing special about Dexter is he likes to play in lakes and ponds and will step his paws in on a hot summer day to cool off. Dexter is really a great dog. Feel free to contact us with any questions (Katie 515-537-4094).

The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
