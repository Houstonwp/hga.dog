Isaac is an incredibly sweet and cuddly 1-year old boy who has never raced. He has quite a bit of energy (for a greyhound), but that doesn't stop him from sleeping for the majority of the day. He loves to play with his toys and his other greyhound buddies. When being introduced to cats, he is interested, but runs off as if he is scared. He is crate trained, impeccable house manners, and has not had one accident or chewed one item he should not have. Isaac is being fostered in Ames.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Isaac at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
