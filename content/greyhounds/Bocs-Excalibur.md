Here is X, or better known in the racing world as Boc's Excalibur! His date of birth is Jauary 7, 2007. X has a beautiful, unusual brindle coat. X is good with dogs (including small dogs), cats and birds! He seems to like the company of other dogs. Xâs foster mom says he is very sweet, loves to be with his people, and enjoyed meeting children. X is in the Sioux Falls SD area. He kennels very well and seems to be a happy go lucky boy!

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
