Kapow is a beautiful brindle boy, about 3 years old (7/13/14).  Does steps like a champ, sleeps through the night in his kennel, quiet, has settled in very well with all the dogs in his foster home. He loves to sleep in the living room on a dog bed.  Good personality, good with a whippet in the home, but we have not cat tested him.  He is a beautiful big boy!

If you would like to meet this dog, please e-mail HGA at jodye83@gmail.com or call 515-967-6564 (please leave a message) and we will get back to you as soon as possible with more information.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
