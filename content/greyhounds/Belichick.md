Introducing Belichick! His foster family is calling him Benny, although he will come to just about any name. Benny is a 4 year old boy with unique coloring - it lookes like gray and white, but it is called blue and white, and is very rare. Benny loves to be petted and scratched around his ears! Attention is his favorite reward, but he really, really likes to eat. Benny has quickly learned how to walk up and down the slick wooden stairs in our home. He loves to follow us around, and I think he would like it if we all stayed in one room so he could keep track of us. Benny really likes to go on walks around our block, he does not pull unless if he sees something he thinks is worth chasing. We don't think Benny is going to be able to live with a small dog or cat, but he would like to live with another large dog. He is also good with children. Benny enjoys playing with stuffed toys that have squeakers in them, riding in the car, and going for long walks. Benny goes to the bathroom outside on walks, and in our fenced yard.  Would you like to adopt this beautiful, well behaved boy?

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
