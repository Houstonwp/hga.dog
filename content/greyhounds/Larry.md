Larry (Bartâs Live Wire) just turned 4 years old.  Larrry is adjusting to home life pretty well.  He is living with other greyhounds and a Itailian Greyhound and is doing well with them.  However,  we need to be careful with small animals that resemble bunnies.  He is a good boy who kennels very well, is housetrained and enjoys stetching out in the evening!  Larry is a beautiful red brindle.  Please come and see him at the next meet and greet.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Larry at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
