Oriana is a wonderful girl who's 10 years old and ready for retirement! She does well with other dogs. With cats it depends on the cat's attitude. If they stand their ground she will respect that. If they run from her she will chase. She loves to chew on bones and play. She has a funny growly way of talking to you. Oriana is very sweet and these older girls are really something special. Oriana has been in foster care for over a year, she truly deserves her forever home. Please come meet her! 


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Oriana at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
