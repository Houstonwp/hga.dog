This is Ryan. He is a big boy, racing at about 79 pounds. He turns 3 in September. Ryan is crate trained and doing great on house training. He tested well with our cat. He is staying with a foster family in Ames where he will be living with a cat and a school age child.


If you would like to meet this dog, please e-mail HGA at HeartlandGreyhound@outlook.com or call 515-967-6564 (please leave a message) and we will get back to you as soon as possible with more information.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
