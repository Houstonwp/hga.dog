Tilly (Eastside Tilly) is a sweet little lady who's looking for a new place to rest her head. 

Tilly is a sweet gal who just had her 8th birthday.  Tilly has
wonderful manners, walks perfectly on leash, and really enjoys walks
with her foster brother.  She does well with small and large dogs,
also cats, but would probably do best with older/polite children since
the young kids make her a bit nervous.  Tilly is a bit on the timid
side, but given a day or so, she warms up quickly to her new
surroundings.  Stairs and hardwood floors are no issue for this pro,
and she does not try to get up on the furniture at all either.  Tilly
is not a fan of the crate, but that's just fine since she doesn't
bother a thing while left out to roam the house while left alone, and
also does well in the car.  Tilly is more than happy to lay on her bed
and be with her people.  With the warmer weather coming we suspect she
might be a master sunbather as well.

Tilly will be fine as an only dog, or in a home with other pets.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $200. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
