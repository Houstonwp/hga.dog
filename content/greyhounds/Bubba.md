This is Bubba (JMM State Runner), a beautiful fawn male who turned 4 on February 14, 2010. He is very affectionate and well mannered. Bubba walks well on a leash and is both house and crate trained. He is very good with other dogs and is small dog or cat correctable. Currently Bubba is being fostered in Omaha.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Bubba at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
