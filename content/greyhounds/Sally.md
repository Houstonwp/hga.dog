Here is Sally, known at the track as Astar Syco Sally. She is two years old, a cute little thing who is learning that she can't go first everywhere. She is pretty excited to see you when you get home, but settles down nicely. She is small dog safe, but we are still working with her on cats. She is good in the kennel, and has been accident-free in the home. She has a beautiful silky black coat that shines. Sally would make a great running partner, she loves her people and likes to be close to them.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Sally at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
