There are some fosters that you can tell are wonderful the moment they walk into your home. Huey (Hilltex Huey, 3 1/2 years old) is one of those dogs. 

Huey is being fostered in Omaha. He loves attention. He crates easily. He ignores cats. On his walks through Dundee he is fascinated by squirrels as they disappear around the back of the tree by the time he reaches it. He gets along with dogs all shapes and sizes.

He is too sweet for words and would be a wonderful addition to any home.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Huey at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
