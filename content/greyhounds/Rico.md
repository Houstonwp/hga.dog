Rico is a big boy who will be 2 in November 2014 and is being fostered in the Omaha area. He has such a sweet disposition, is a lover and will put you in a trance with his beautiful eyes. He does like to have people around and will follow you if you leave the room. He does well with steps but is still getting used to the vinyl floors. It took a couple of days, but Rico has come to LOVE his pillows to lay/sit down on. We kennel him during the day when we are not home. He is still working on kenneling â it just takes a couple of treats to get him to go in. At night he does like to sleep on the floor by our bed on his pillow, but will stay in the room until you get up for the day even if you forget to close the door. He is currently being fostered with another Greyhound and loves to roam the yard with her. Rico is still learning to play with his toys. He walks nicely by your side on a leash, he may get distracted and look around but never pulls.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Rico at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
