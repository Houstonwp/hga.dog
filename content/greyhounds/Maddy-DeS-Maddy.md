Introducing Maddy (De'S Maddy), a charming 1.5 year old girl.

It is hard to tell from the pictures, but Maddy is a happy and affectionate girl. She only wanted to come close for cuddling instead of posing, so looks a little more serious than she really is.

Maddy loves being talked to and pet. She's a smart girl who is learning commands quickly, and she loves playing with toys. She rides very nicely in the car, walks nicely on the leash, and is tolerant of a bath.

Maddy gets along well with other large dogs, but is too high prey to be around around small dogs and cats.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
