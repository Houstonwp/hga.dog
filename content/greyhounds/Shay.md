Shay, who raced under the name of Schill's Sock, is a very sweet and mild mannered girl who will be four in June.  She does very well with other dogs and currently lives with two other greyhounds.  Shay is fully house trained and is left uncrated during the day when her foster family is gone and has had no accidents.  Shay can be a little timid about new things, but she is quickly learning the ropes in her foster home.  At the moment, Shay tends to be shy around men, but has improved greatly through a lot of TLC in her foster home.  Once she is comfortable around a person, Shay is affectionate and a wonderful companion animal.  Her foster family considers her a pleasure to have in their home.  Shay would be an excellent addition to an adoptive home that would love to help her continue to gain confidence in her new life of retirement.  


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Shay at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
