Bahama mama is a 4 year old loving little girl. She loves to be at your side while you complete your work around the house. Bahama is cat friendly as she loves to sniff them every chance she gets. She does wonderful on a leash and has learned stairs almost overnight. She is currently living in an apartment and an only greyhound and doing well. Her history does indicate that she may not be good with smaller children. Who knows how much more she will learn before finding her forever home!


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Bahama at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
