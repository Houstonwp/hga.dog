Mindy is a 6 mo old red brindle puppy. She is a happy little girl that loves everyone and all animals. She prefers to play with soft toys and enjoys chewing on bones. In some ways she is a typical puppy and you have to keep an eye on her for chewing on inappropriate things and house training. We are working on the house training and it is getting better. She is well on her way to learning the rules of living on a house. Mindy does have a injured front right paw. When she was born there was nerve damage to the paw and she tends to hop on 3 legs. We are evaluating her use of the paw versus amputating. Either way I know Mindy will go through life a happy girl. 


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Mindy at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
