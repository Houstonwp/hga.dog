Apple Juice is a sweet, 4 yr old brindle girl. She is a quiet girl and knows her steps and slippery floors well. Walks on leash with ease. In fact she loves her walks so much she will beg for more. Is doing extremely well with just about everything as if she was born and raised in the house already. She loves squeaky toys and soft cuddle toys and chew  bones. You just can't seem to pass by this sweet face with out stopping to give her a kiss. She is a bit shy at first but quickly gives kisses back and is eager to please. She gets along fine with our house full of big dogs and  and is very curious about everything new and just has to check it out. Just can't lose on this girl.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Apple Juice at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
