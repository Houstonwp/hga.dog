Meet Paris, or Got A Hot Tip in his racing days.  The Hot Tip is that he is a wonderful 4 year old male who is adjusting quite well to retired life and will fit right into your home and your heart.  Paris is currently living with two other greyhounds; one is his brother Nolan who we adopted in November and the other is a younger female who he has no problems with at all.  He also gets along wonderfully with our Miniature Schnauzer and 1 year old daughter.  Paris has learned potty training and is starting to get more comfortable with stairs, he just needs a little more practice with indoor steps.  Paris kennels well and sleeps right through the night.  He is starting to figure out that he can sleep in a little bit now that he is retired.  Paris is currently living in Omaha and would love to meet you.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Paris at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
