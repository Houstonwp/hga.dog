Elli is a beautiful little Irish girl who was the 2001 track champion in Scotland.  She is 9 years old and very playful.  She headed straight to the toybox in her foster home and started pulling out fuzzy toys.  Elli knows her name and she's bouncy and curious.  Her foster mom says she is Miss Personality Plus!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Elli at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
