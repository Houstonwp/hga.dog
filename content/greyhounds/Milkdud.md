Here is Astar Milkdud, she is a wonderfully mannered 3 year old who is learning the retired life very quickly.  She is getting along great with her foster family in Omaha.  She learned her crate, stairs and potty training right away.  She does fine on the leash and is a very well mannered and affectionate little gal, plus her tail curls like a corkscrew!  Milkdud would be a perfect addition to your family!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Milkdud at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
