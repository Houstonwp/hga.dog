This is Hope, a very affectionate five year old female. Her foster family reports that Hope is a great girl - she is an affection hog! She loves to play with the other pets. Hope whoos at you when she wants to go out. She is kenneled during the day and sleeps by the bed at night. Hope likes to go for walks and will jump in the car herself. She pulls a litlle bit at first but then settles down. Hope also knows her name and will come when called. She does need a well secured yard, and she is afraid of thunderstorms - she cries and pants. Theyâve Â found that kenneling her with a fan on close by seems to quell this. Hope will make someone very happy!


 


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Hope at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
