Tink is a recently retired 6 year old female greyhound.  Greets everyone like a long lost best friend who is happy to see you.  She is a confident girl who does well with new experiences taking them all in stride.  Walks nicely on leash, rides and loads well into car.  Would love a home where she can give and receive love.  Would be fine as an only dog or as a companion to an existing dog. Crate trained and sleeps through the night, housebroken with no accidents. She is a very playful and happy girl who is living with two other greyhounds and a cat.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
