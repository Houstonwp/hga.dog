Gabby (Gable Ambrosia) is listed on her paperwork as a "red brindle" which is a really striking color in person. She is almost 4 years old and ready for retired life! Gabby is a cute, petite girl who's very affectionate. She comes when called and loves to nap in her kennel (of course she has a comfy bed in there.)  She loves her walks and is doing well on the leash. We've made some trips down the stairs, but needs a little more practice there. She'll make a great addition to someone's family.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Gabby at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
