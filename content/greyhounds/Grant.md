Grant just turned three a few months ago. This stunning boy is a sweet, mellow, and curious guy. He decided to be class clown at racing school, and didn't graduate. 

He has super soft, thick fur which feels wonderful to run your fingers through; and he doesn't mind the attention. He loves toys, and going for his walks.

Grant is good with cats and other dogs.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
