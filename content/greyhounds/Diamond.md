Diamond is 7 Â½ year old female greyhound who is looking for a new home. Due to a change in her ownersâ health and living situation, they are no longer able to provide her with the kind of home she deserves. What that means to Diamondâs new family is that she is already used to being in a home and wants nothing more than a fenced yard where she can run a little bit, and a family who loves her and has time to spend with her. Pictures and more information soon!


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Diamond at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $175. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
