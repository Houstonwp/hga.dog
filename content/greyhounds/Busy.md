Busy and Ally are two 8 yr-old mama dogs who have been together a long time and would love to go to the same home. Busy is white with black spots and ticking, and look at that smile on her face! She has no trouble with slick floors or steps, and will potty on leash. Busy showed very little interest in a cat. These girls are both total sweethearts - you have to meet them!

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Busy at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $175. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
