Watermelon is a former mama dog who just turned 7 years old.  She is a very small, beautiful girl who loves to stick right by your side.  Watermelon seems to be OK with small animals.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Watermelon at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
