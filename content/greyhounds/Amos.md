Meet A Star Amos, a pretty brindle male who is about 3 Â½ years old.  Amos just came off the track on Friday, October 23.  He tested okay with small dogs but we may have to work with him on the kitties.  With work he may be able to live with them.  Amos is doing stairs well and adjusting to life off the track.  He is already sleeping in the bedroom with his foster family and the other dogs at night.  Amos loves other dogs and is starting to play with doggy toys. Just give him a doggy bed and he is a happy boy.



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Amos at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
