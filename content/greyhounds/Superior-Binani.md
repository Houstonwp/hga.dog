Here is Superior Binani.  She will be 5 in March.  She is a good little girl that seems to be OK with cats and small dogs.  She has learnedg stairs and kennels well.  When she sees you coming, she spins circles in her kennel, as she is so happy to see you.  Nani would probably do best in a home without small children.



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Superior Binani at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
