Ty, who raced under the name of Keeper D's Sully, is an extremely sweet four year old male. Ty is perpetually happy and loves to be with people. He has an extremely soft white and red coat that is quite striking. Ty is fully house trained and is an excellent car passenger. He is just learning to play with toys and is not sure what to think of them yet. Ty lives with two other greyhounds and does fabulously with them. He is recuperating from surgery on his hock. Once healed, Ty will be a great walking companion. Ty has had limited exposure to cats and small dogs.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Tylone at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
