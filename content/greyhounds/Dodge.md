Meet Dodge. He's an 8 year old fawn male with a great personality. He is currently getting along fine with cats and another dog in an apartment in Ames. Dodge's foster family says he is a calm soul, walks really nice on leash, and it taking it slow with the stairs.

The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and olderÂ  through HGA is $175. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
