Toasti is 7 years old and she is ready for her retirement home!  She's been busy with puppies and as you can see she can use some R&R to rest up and get her girlish figure back.  She is considered "small animal correctable" and her foster mom says she is an easy-going girl.  


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Toasti at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
