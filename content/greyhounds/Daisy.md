"RJ's Toe, or Daisy as we call her, is a 4 year old brindle female.  She is a gentle gal who loves to play with toys.  Her calm demeanor makes her an ideal greyhound to adopt.  She is currently living with cats, a small dog and another grey.  You can see in her eyes that she is looking for a loving home to retire in.  She will be a wonderful addition to your family."

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
