Shane is a 75 pound brindle boy that will turn 8 in September 2015. He is great on a leash. Has lived with a small terrier and done just fine. Shane is not cat safe. He needs to be in a home with another greyhound. He is a sweet gentleman. 

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Shane at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.The adoption fee for senior greyhounds (age 7 and older) through HGA is $225. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if registered through the Petfinder website at the time of adoption) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
