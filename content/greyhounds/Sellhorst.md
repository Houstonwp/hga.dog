Sellhorst is a wonderful dog!  He gets along great with all animals big and small and has no interest in cats.  Sellhorst is sweet and kind, and he seems to like when kids are around.  He zooms up and down stairs and loves to come to you to be petted.  He will follow you from room to room to lay where ever you are at.  Sellhorst is just happy being in the same room as you, but not a velcro dog.  He is very quiet for only being two years old.  Sellhorst will do best in a quiet home.
 

  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Sellhorst at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
