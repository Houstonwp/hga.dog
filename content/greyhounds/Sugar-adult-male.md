Hello, my name is FF Sugar!  My foster parents call me Sugar or Shug for short and  I just turned 3 years old in April.  I was a good racer but I injured my rear left leg last October and had to retire.  My leg is all better now and you canât even tell I was injured.  Iâm really starting to enjoy retirement and all of the things that go with it.  I live in a house with a greyhound, a black lab and a cat.  I have a lot of fun with the 2 dogs, but the cat doesnât like me very much so I stay away from her.  I do stairs easily and kennel very well (thatâs because I get a treat when I go in the kennel).  I also like children and like to go on car rides.  When Iâm just hanginâ out at home, I like to play with my toys and sleep in the âroachâ position.  My foster parents tell me Iâm a good boy and that some family is going to be very fortunate when they get to take me to my forever home.  I would love to meet you!

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
