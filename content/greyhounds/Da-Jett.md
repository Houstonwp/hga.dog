Da Jett just turned 2 years old.  He is living with 2 small children and a small Italian Greyhound dog.  Da Jett (aka...Jett) is a very calm and quiet.  He loves being around people.  He does well with both kids and small dogs.  He kennels well and has never had an accident in the kennel or house.  He loves to go outside and take walks. Jett has a freindly personality and would make a wonderful family pet.



If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Jett at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
