Pfannys B Nimble or "Nimby" is a beautiful 6 year old female.  She is living with a lab, a corgi and 3 cats and getting along just fine.   Nimby is a quiet little girl who is loving her dogbed in the livingroom and quickly adjusting to the couch potato lifestyle.



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Nimby at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
