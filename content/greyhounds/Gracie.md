Gracie is a 6 1/2 year old blue female greyhound who weighs about 55 pounds.  She is a calm, quiet and affectionate dog.  She is ok with cats and loves the outdoors, rides well in cars and gets along with other dogs once acquainted.  Gracie is fully house trained and familiar with being kenneled during the day.   Her foster mom says she loves to go for walks and has a cute little bounce in her step!




  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Gracie at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
