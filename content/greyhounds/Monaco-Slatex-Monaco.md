Slatex Monaco will be 8 years old in March 2016 and is being fostered in Ames. Monaco is a very mellow, patient girl who calmly takes life in stride. Sheâs quickly learned to wait at the door after walks to get her paws wiped off, was quite the trooper for her bath, and happily stands around for scratches. She seems to do nicely meeting other dogs, but is a bit too excited about meeting the cat in her foster home to live with cats (although she did cat test alright with a more assertive, grumpy cat in a cage). While she does not appear to be impressed with the snow, she does walk wonderfully on a leash and has no accidents in her crate. Her favorite things in life so far are food, treats(!), all kinds of chin and ear scratches, and a nice place to lay down. Sheâs also shown some interest in the cats furry toys, and might end up enjoying those quite a bit if she gets some of her own.  

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $200. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
