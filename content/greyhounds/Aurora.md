Aurora is a playful fawn beauty, 5 years old. She loves her dog pals and seems more interested in treats then the cat. Aurora kennels well during the day and sleeps on her pillow by our bed all night. She will answer to her name and lay down on command. Aurora walks easily on a lead and is house trained,but beware she is a bacon thief!! And she loves her fuzzy toys and the Christmas tree skirt.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
