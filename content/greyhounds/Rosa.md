Rosa is a pretty girl who is just about 18 months old.  She is ok with small animals like cats.  Check back soon for more information, or just look at those big brown eyes!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Rosa at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
