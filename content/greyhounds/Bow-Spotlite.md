Spot (Bow Spotlite) is as handsome as they come. He has 'puppy ears' and the most soulful eyes.  He is a 3 yr old, smaller male who was retired because of a torn ligament. He is friendly and affectionate without being needy. He gets along nicely with his foster sisters and would do well either as an only dog or with canine siblings. Spot loves to wiggle around on his back for a belly rub, and he also smiles in greeting. It really is adorable. He does not bark or chew, and once the initial excitement wears off, he walks very well on leash.   Spot has lots of energy and would probably respond well to fun, positive training.



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Spot at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
