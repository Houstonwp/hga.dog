Sissy is just a great dog.  She's red brindle, 3 years old, and just full of personality!  Sissy is small dog safe and we are working on being better around the kitties.  She seems more playful with them rather than harmful.  When she hears a noise she will follow it.  Sissy is a cute sleeper, sometimes sleeping half under the bed.  She is completely house trained with no accidents what so ever.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Sissy at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
