Fluke, known as PJ's Flyin Fluke at the track, is a beautiful red fawn male with a dark mask. He is 5 1/2 years old and is not cat safe, but didn't show any interest in a small dog when we tested him. Fluke is staying with a foster family in North English, Iowa.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Fluke at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
