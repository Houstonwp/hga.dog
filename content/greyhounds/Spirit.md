Here is Competitivespirt (yes, that is how it is spelled!)   He just likes to be called Spirit and he is a wonderfully mannered big boy who is starting to learn retired life quite well.  He will turn 5 in December.  Spirit kennels well, sleeps all night and has had no incidents in the house.  Spirit is getting better with smaller animals, he is learning to live with a Min. Schnauzer but I would be very cautious with him and cats right now anyway.  Spirit gets along fine with all of our hounds and loves our three year old daughter.  Spirit is currently learning the retired life in Omaha, NE. 


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Spirit at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
