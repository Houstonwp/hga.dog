Encinco (MRL Encinco) is really adapting to his new foster home. He already plays with his housemate Dooley in the yard. He likes to haul the stuffed toy outside and also loads them in his crate. He is probably going to be pretty playful.  He's not afraid of much and went down the basement stairs without much hesitation. He's very friendly and loves to be petted. He has a beautiful brindle coat with a curly-Q tail. Encinco will be 4 years old in March 2012.



If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Encinco at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
