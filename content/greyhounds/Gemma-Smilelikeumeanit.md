Meet Gemma (Smilelikeumeanit), a darling of a girl. Gemma is 7, and a teeny-tiny 54lbs. She is a sweet and loving girl. She's a little shy at first, but playful and friendly once she knows you. "At first" is pretty much the first 10-15 minutes.

Gemma is good with kids, she lived with a baby up until the child was 2 without issues. She tested well with a cat and small dog, and was non-reactive to chickens as well. She does not get on furniture.

Send us a message if you'd like to meet Gemma!

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $200. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
