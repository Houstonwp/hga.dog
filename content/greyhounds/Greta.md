Meet Greta -- her racing name was Gratify Pepper.
 
She will be nine years old in November and is a very good girl.  She is good with small animals and bigger ones too!  Greta has a pretty coat and a nice personality.  She spins in the kennel when you go to get her out.
 
Greta started her racing career in Dubuque and moved then to Wheeling in PA and raced 157 races.  She was then moved to the farm and had two litters of pups, for a total of 13 pups.  It is now time for her to retire, and she is loving the retired life!



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Greta dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
