Geri is a pretty red brindle with white socks.  She is 7 1/2 years old and she is already adjusting well to retirement!  Her foster mom says you would think she had been in a home for a long time.  She knows her name,  she's good with stairs, and she is starting to know phrases like lay down, outside, and go to bed.  Geri is currently living with other greyhounds and an Italian greyhound.  She is small-animal correctable.  Come meet her - she is full of personality and has a real spring in her step! 



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Geri at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
