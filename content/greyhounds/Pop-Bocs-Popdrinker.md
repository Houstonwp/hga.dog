Pop (aka Boc's Popdrinker at the track) is just off the track at 3 1/2 years old and is adjusting well to retired life! He is good with small dogs, stairs and loves his people. Pop sleeps in the bedroom at night, loves baths and is completely housetrained. He loves to have things going on which would make him a perfect family and active lifestyle dog.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Pop at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure se is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
