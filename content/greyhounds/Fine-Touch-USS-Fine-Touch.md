Introducing Fine Touch (USS Fine Touch) a lovely 8 year old girl who's looking for her forever family. Fine Touch enjoyed a career as a great racer, then as a wonderful brood mama. Now she's retired and ready to try her paw at pet life. 

Fine is a cheerful and confident dog. She likes her bed and her kennel, preferring to eat in the kennel. She enjoys playing with her greyhound foster brother, and chasing rabbits.

Fine Touch is good with small dogs, and is living with a cat.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $200. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
