Here is IWA Red Tiger, he is a very polite and well mannered almost two year old.  He will turn two in September.  Tiger is doing fine with house training and is starting to figure out home life quite well.  Tiger has no issues with our other Greys, Min Schnauzer or three year old daughter.  He is starting to show his personality more and more each day.  Tiger would make a wonderful first greyhound!  Tiger is being fostered in Omaha, NE.  If you have any questions about him feel free to contact Ryan at rthurber3@cox.net.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet TIger at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
