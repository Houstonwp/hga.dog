Here is Wind Energy, a beautiful champagne brindle.  His trainer called him Energy or E.  His date of birth is 1-27-07, so he is 4 1/2.  Energy is getting along well with the foster familyâs cat and two dogs.  He is a sweet, docile dog who loves attention and is always wagging his tail â it really never stops! He is doing stairs, kenneling well, and has had no accidents in the house. 


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Energy at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
