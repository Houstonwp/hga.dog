Panda Bear (where do you think she got that name?) will be 2 years old in June.   She is a sweet, playful, curious girl.  She kennels well and is currently living with 2 other greyhounds and 2 kitties, and seems to be getting along with everybody.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Panda Bear at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
