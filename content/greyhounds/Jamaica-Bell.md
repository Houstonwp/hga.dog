Here is Jamaica Bell - she will be two in April.  She is a sweet, quiet girl who is a bit shy but warms up quickly and then stays close to you, even a lick or two on your hands, right after you wash them! :)  She is not cat safe, however is good with our small dog, so we would have to test with your small animal.  She sleeps quitely through the night, getting up anytime you do.  She has quickly picked up house training and she is doing very well.  She is a real sweetheart!


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Jamaica Bell at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
