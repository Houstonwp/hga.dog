Hi there. My name at the racetrack was Flying Stanhope, and if youâre familiar with Iowa geography, youâll know that I was named after a town in north-central Iowa. But now that Iâm retired, I just go by Stan. Iâm a pretty, well-muscled boy and people tell me that I have a beautiful black-and-white coat. Iâm 3 years old and although Iâm quiet and gentle, I am having a lot of fun learning how to play. I live with another Greyhound and an energetic Jack Russell terrier and I get along well with them both. Iâd love to meet you, so please ask about me! 


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Stan at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
