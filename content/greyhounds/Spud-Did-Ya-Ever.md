Did Ya Ever is a four year old greyhound who is in need of a good home. He is mostly white, with a small brown patch on his side that looks like a potato, which I assume is why he responds to the name Spud! He is a very sweet boy who has mastered stairs quicker than any other greyhound I have had before. A rather mellow dog who does not seem to be made all that nervous by new environments. Does not whine at all. Spud likes to lay in his kennel, not because he is nervous but because he just wants to chill. He took an interest in the cat at first, but quickly learned to accept it as a roommate rather than something to pursue. Spud would be a very easy and gentle addition to any home! Spud is being fostered in the Cedar Rapids area.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
