Rena is a wonderful 10 yr old senior girl who was recently surrendered from a private home. She is small dog and cat safe, quiet, and lived in an apartment (with many stairs!) for some time with a foster family. She and Zena (the black dog in the picture) lived together for more than 5 years and would love to be adopted together, although we understand Â that might not happen. RenaÂ does great on a leash for exercise & potty breaks. Seniors are move-in ready and can be adopted for a reduced fee of $175 each, or if you adopt both of these sweethearts - $325 total. These girls are the true "golden girls" of the greyhound world!
If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Rena at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.
The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $175. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
