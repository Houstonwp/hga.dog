Foxy is a lovely two year old girl.  She is very sweet, loves attention, and gets along well with other dogs. Foxy likes squeaky toys, going for a ride, and food!  She does well on leash and lets you know when she needs to go out. Foxy kennels nicely and does stairs well â what a great dog! Weâre not sure about cats yet, she tested OK initially but may need more observation.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
