Do Hicky is a very sweet velco boy, born 2/16/10, who will follow you around just to be near. He has beautiful amber eyes. Â He's not always so happy to be kenneled at first but settles down.Â He is very intrigued by toys and the noises they make, and is starting to figure out what to do with them. "Do" (sometimes Scooby) gets along well with the other greyhounds in his foster home but is probably a little too interested in cats. He seems to do well with kids. Do does stairs well, gets into the car nicely, and gets excited to see his people when they get home. Â Do Hicky's last race was 9/4/13. Â 

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Do at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
