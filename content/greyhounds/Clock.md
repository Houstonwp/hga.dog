Barts Clockwork, or Clock for short is a handsome boy who will turn 4 in June.  Clock gets along great with another male and female greyhound as well as an energetic miniature schnauzer.  His foster family has a 10 month old daughter who he loves to be around but he might be a little skittish around children who are more active.  Clock has had no accidents in the house and is crate trained perfectly.  He can be a little shy at first but once he gets comfortable in his surroundings he fits right in perfectly.  We think Clock would do best in a home where he has another dog for company.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Clock at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
