This is Scotty, a girl dog with a boy's name! She was known as WWW Beamonscotty at the track. Scotty is a playful and sweet little girl. She is living with two other greyhounds and a cat.  She is also good with small dogs. She smiles! She is doing very well with house training and learning the retired life.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Scotty at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
