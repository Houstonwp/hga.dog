Here is Double Cheese!  He will be 5 on 8-3-11.  Double Cheese is a greyhound with PERSONALITY PLUS!!  He has a beautiful shiny black coat and white on his chest and a white tip on the tail.  He is strong and quick and a real go getter!  He takes a flight of stairs in one jump.  He kennels well and is full of personality.  He seems to do well with a small dog.  He loves his treat of a marshmallow when he goes into the kennel.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
