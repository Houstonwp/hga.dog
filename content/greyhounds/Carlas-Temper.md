Carla is a four year old dark brindle female with white on her chest and toes. She is good with small dogs, but would need further evaluation regarding cats. Carla is house trained, and a very sweet girl. She is on the smaller side, 55-57 pounds. She came to HGA from a racing kennel in Florida. For a greyhound she is vocal, more of a talker than a barker. When we come home she has a story to tell about the day. Are you the person she should be telling her story to? 


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet a Carla at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
