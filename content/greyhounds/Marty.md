Marty (aka Marty Ball) will be 2 years old in September.  He is a well mannered, gentle and lovable boy who enjoys being outside and playing in the backyard.  His favorite thing to do is run circles around you while kicking like a rodeo horse and/or chasing, or getting chased by, his greyhound friends.  He is currently getting along superbly with two greyhounds and a house cat (which he ignores).  Marty is still pretty young so every once in a while he likes to chew on things but he responds very quickly to a calm âNoâ.  He has learned what sliding glass doors are, gets around great on hard flooring but has not mastered stairs yet.  Very lovable, great personality, smart and a dash of playful pup pretty much sums it upâ¦he is a joy to have around while waiting to find his forever home.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Marty at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
