PRS Redneck is a gorgeous 3-1/2 year old red male who is very easy going and a real sweetheart. He loves to get attention and he gives kisses!  Heâs quiet, gentle and goes with the flow of everything. He even knows how to sit and give you his paw! He walks great on a leash, has no problem riding in a car, loves meeting people and is very easy to be around. He is living with 2 other greyhounds and 2 small dogs and get along well with all of them. Redneck will probably do best in a home with children over the age of 10.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
