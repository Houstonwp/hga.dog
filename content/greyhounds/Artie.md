Meet Artie!  He's a sweet boy about 10 months old.  He was picked up as a stray and doesn't have ear tattoos, so we aren't sure of his age.   Artie is a good boy who gets along fine with kids, cats and other dogs - he will make himself a part of your family before you know it!  As you can see from the picture, one of Artie's favorite things about being a pet is having "stuff" to collect - toys, socks, shoes....  He is kind of small for a male greyhound, about 50 pounds and probably won't get much bigger.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Artie at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
