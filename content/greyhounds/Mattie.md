Mattie is just off the track and doing fine in her foster home. She will be 4 years old in October. Mattie is quickly learning the routines of pet life - stairs, house training, kenneling and walking on leash.  She is very friendly and loves people! Mattie is being fostered in the Bellevue, NE area.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Mattie at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
