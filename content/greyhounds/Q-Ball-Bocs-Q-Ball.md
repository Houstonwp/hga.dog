 Q Ball is a very good boy. He was born 7-3-2009, so he is just over three years old. He is currently living with a 7 year old boy and doing great. Q Ball has tested well with other dogs, even smaller dogs. He is also fine being an only dog. Pictures don't do him justice - he is a stunning boy! His cast has been off for some time and he is a great leash walker.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
