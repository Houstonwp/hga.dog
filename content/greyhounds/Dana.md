Meet Dana! She's an 8 year old girl who has already been in a home and knows how this retirement thing works. She is a lovable and well mannered dog who  just wants to please and spend time with her new family.  She enjoys being outside and playing with her toys.   Dana has caught on to her new routine quickly and does well with clicker training - she may be learning to fetch!  She walks nicely on the leash, crates and rides in the car well and has great house manners.  She will softly let you know when she needs to go out.  Dana shows some interest in cats and would have to be very carefully introduced to and supervised with any cats in the house. She would be a great first greyhound for a family without cats.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $225. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
