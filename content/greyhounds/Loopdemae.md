Meet Loopdemae - her racing name was Boc's Loopdemae.  She is Ricky Bobby's sister and looks just like him!   Loopdemae was born in November of 2006 and she is a beautiful champagne color brindle.  She just came in at the beginning of June so we donât know much about her, but she has tested okay with the cat and a small dog.  Loopdemae is getting along great in her foster home, kennels well, has learned the stairs, and seems to get along on all flooring surfaces.  She LOVES to play out in the yard, and likes to play chase!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Loopdemae at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
