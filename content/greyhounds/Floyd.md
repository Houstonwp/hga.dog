Meet Floyd.  He is a very friendly 5 year old. His personality makes you just want to cuddle and hug him.  He is very calm and a little shy to start with but he warms up to you quickly.  He has been a joyful addition to his foster home where he lives with cats, a small dog and another grey.  His kennel is his favorite place to lay down and he has never had an accident in the house. Floyd is a little unsure about tile floors but he is challenging his fears daily. He will be a wonderful companion for some lucky individual or family.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
