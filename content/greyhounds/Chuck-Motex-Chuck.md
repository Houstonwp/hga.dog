Introducing Chuck (Motex Chuck) a handsome red boy, with expressive ears, who turned 4 in February.

Chuck is a fantastic hound who is ready to find his forever home. He's good with stairs, rides well in the car, walks nicely on a leash, and he's good with other dogs large and small. He's also good with children.

Chuck is very outgoing and friendly. He loves people, and has a tail that wags in a circle when he's very happy. 

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
