Here's Ranger (Motex Ranger)!

 I am a 3 year young male who raced 79 times, winning 5 and placing in another 27! I just retired in late June, but have excelled at home life. I live with two greyhounds, a Shiba Inu, and a cat, and get along with all of them. I can do outside and inside stairs. I like to play with toys, and am an excellent hoarder of said toys. I also hoard small dog and cat beds. I will sleep in a kennel, but prefer to be by the bed. I can roo with the best of them, and I have taught my brother how to as well. Being freshly retired, I am very strong and need some more practice on a leash. I learn quickly, though, and like doing new things.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
