Say hello to Chip!  He'll be 2 years old in August and his foster family says he's a fun-loving guy.  He is currently living with other greyhounds and cats and seems to be getting along fine with everybody.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Chip at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
