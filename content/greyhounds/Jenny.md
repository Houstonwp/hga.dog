Jenny is a pretty red brindle female with expressive markings and floppy ears.  She turned two years old in January.  She walks well on a leash and practically prances around the block.  Jenny always wants to be with her people, and will quietly follow them around the house.  She is just learning to ask for pets and will gently put her head on you to snuggle.  She also likes to look out windows and chew on her bone.  She is not small animal safe but gets along well with another greyhound in her foster home.  Jenny would love to wag her tail for you when you come home and sleep right next to your bed!     


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Jenny at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
