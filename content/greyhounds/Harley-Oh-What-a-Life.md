If you're looking for a big boy with a big personality, Harley is the greyhound for you.  Known at the track as Oh What A Life, Harley is almost 5 years old. Harley is an energetic dog who loves to run around the yard and go for walks. He isn't small dog or cat safe, but gets along with other big dogs.  Harley would love to be in a home where there are toys and people to play with! Harley is being fostered in the Omaha area.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
