Annie & Mimi are a bonded pair of seniors who have lived together for 8 years. They are a sweet duo who are both good with cats and other dogs. Annie and Mimi's birthdays are on after the other too, July 13th and 14th!

Annie (Dutch LeAnn) is the white and brindle, she is 13. She's a quiet girl who loves a soft pillow and some ear scratches. She can do stairs, but long staircases are difficult for her.

Mimi (Delray Kiss Me) is a pretty brindle girl who is 10 years old. Mimi loves to go for walks. She would like to have access to a closet when there is thunder or fireworks.


These two must be adopted together; one adoption fee will cover both dogs.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $200. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
