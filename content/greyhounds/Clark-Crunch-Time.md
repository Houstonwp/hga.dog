Clark (Crunch Time) just celebrated his 4th birthday, and what he wants is a forever home. He's an affectionate boy who will cuddle with anyone who sits still long enough. He's a quiet, easygoing boy, quick to wag his tail, and always up for being petted.

Small children make Clark nervous, so he'd be best in a home with children over 8-years-old or with adults. He's being fostered with another greyhound and two indoor cats, and doing well with them all. Clark is not safe around outdoor cats.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Clark at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
