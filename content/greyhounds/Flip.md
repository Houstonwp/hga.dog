Here is Catcher Tek better known as Flip - he will be 5 years old in June.  
Flip is a good boy who is adjusting to life off the track.  He kennels well, is house trained,  does stairs like a rocket and is interested in what a home has to offer.  He is small animal safe and is a beautiful brindle color.  Flip is currently living in North Liberty, Iowa with Dewey.  Flip is Earl's brother and both are up for adoption through Heartland Greyhound Adoption.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
