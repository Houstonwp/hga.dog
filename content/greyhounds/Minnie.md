"Minnie Express" will be 2 years old in September.  She has a sweet disposition and gets along well with cats and other dogs.  Minnie will be fostered in Cedar Rapids.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Minnie at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
