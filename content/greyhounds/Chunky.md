At the racetrack, I was known as IWA Chunky, but now that I'm in retirement, I just go by Chunky. I'm not sure that Chunky is a very accurate description for a greyhound, but it's my name and I like it! I'm a 5-year-old little, brindle male. But don't let my size fool you! I'm proof that good things come in small packages. I've got personality galore and when we're outside, I'll practically beg everyone to play with me. I'm very friendly and outgoing. I have four white stockings, a pretty white blaze on my chest and nose, and a white tip on my tail so that it resembles a candle! I'm living with another Greyhound and an energetic Jack Russell terrier and I get along well with them both. I'd love to meet you, so please ask about me!

  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Chunky at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
