Here is Dee (or DeeDee, aka "Love Like Crazy" at the track).    Dee is 2 years old.  She is learning the ropes of retired life quickly â she does stairs, is housetrained, and is good around small dogs. Dee is good with her foster familyâs two boys, but hasn't quite figured out toys yet. And she has learned to sit on command from the familyâs other dogs!


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Dee at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
