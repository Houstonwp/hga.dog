Fireball a beautiful brindle boy who just turned five years old. Fireball currently lives in a home with another greyhound, small dog, and cat. He does great with all of them- he is interested in the cat but not aggressive towards her. Fireball has no problem with stairs or the wood floors. Fireball is house trained and does well in his kennel during the day.  He is being fostered in the Des Moines area. Fireball will probably do best with older children.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Fireball at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
