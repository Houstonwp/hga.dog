Meet Casey, known at the track as Hilltex Casey. She will be turning 5 in June ('12) and is a very happy girl. Casey has a beautiful white coat with one fawn spot on her neck and a few spots on her ears. She goes up and down the stairs with ease and is very well behaved in the crate. Casey is very playful and LOVES toys, she is even learning to catch her toys mid-air! She is not safe with cats or any small dogs, but she gets along well with the family's other greyhound. Casey is currently being fostered in Omaha, Nebraska. 


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Casey at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
