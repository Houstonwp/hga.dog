I'm Miler (Motex Miler). I am a quiet, gentle 3 year old greyhound. I am pretty laid back and enjoy just laying in my kennel. I do well in my kennel when foster Mom and Dad are gone. I excelled in potty training 101 - A+ my foster mom said - no accidents in the house. When I need to go, I will stand in front of the door....if you don't see me I will paw at the door. 

I like to play with toys - chew them (but not destructive) and toss them in the air when excited with them. I get along great with my foster brother and sister who are greyhounds. They like to run in the yard, but I like to smell around and see what's out there. I do really like to look at the dog in the window but when I go in he is out. Foster mom says it is my reflection - whoever he is - he sure is handsome.

I walk well on the leash. Sometimes my foster brother pulls ahead so I go with the flow and will mush along. We like to chase squirrels but, the little dogs spook me  so I keep away from them. Foster Mom says she will introduce me to a cat someday - I am not real excited about that.

I go in and out on the two steps great and up and down the four steps to the living room good. I am working on the 10 stairs to the upstairs. I do well on slick floors like the linoleum in the kitchen. I go in and foster mom says "Out" so I promptly leave.

I just had my teeth cleaned at the dentist and like to have my teeth brushed. I am looking for a forever family----Will you be mine?

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
