Introducing Flickr! Gable Flickr is a sweet red girl who will be turning 4 on November 28th.  Flickr likes her crate and will go in on her own to chew on, and de-stuff her toys.  Flickr is a love bug, and will snuggle, or hug you if given half a chance.Flickr is good with children and other greyhounds. She will need a home without cats and has not yet been tested with small dogs. Flickr is being fostered in Omaha, NE with another greyhound and a toddler.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Flickr at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
