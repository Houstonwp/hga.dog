This is Nike (formerly known as Boc's Blackberry).  He turned 3 on March 7, 2010.  He retired from racing at the beginning of June due to a broken right back leg, but now he has healed and is all ready to enjoy his life off the track!  He has a beautiful black coat and has filled out since retiring.  He currently weighs around 72 pounds.  He has adjusted quickly to being in a home.  He manages both stairs and hardwood surfaces well, and is learning not to walk into glass doors.  He has a calm personality and loves being near people.  He does not jump up or lick you and has not attempted to get on the sofa (though he may if invited).  He sleeps all night on his dog bed and has done well without a crate.  He loves his stuffed animals (especially the ones that squeak/rattle), but his favorite thing to do is go on walks.  He is very fun to walk and will stay at your pace; he is quiet when meeting other dogs.  In fact, he's quiet most of the time and rarely barks.  He rides well in the car.  Nike would need to be supervised with children, and would be happiest placed in a home with adults only, with or without other dogs.      
 

  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Nike at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
