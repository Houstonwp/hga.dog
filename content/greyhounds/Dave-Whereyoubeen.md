Introducing Dave (Whereyoubeen) this 3.5 year old boy is as handsome as they come. He's a tall boy, who is very friendly and affectionate. He rides very well in the car, and kennels nicely.  

Dave's ears stand up a lot!

Dave did well on his cat test.

We got Dave on 3/22 - more information will come as we get to know him better.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
