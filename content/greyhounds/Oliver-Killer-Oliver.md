Oliver (Killer Oliver) just turned 2 on September 10th.

He is a reserved beautiful black boy who loves his kennel.  He has not had an accident and is quiet in his kennel.  He is learning the home life, and has a very spunky personality that will shine through when you talk to him.  He tends to want to smile and bark if he wants to play.  Such a nice boy!! Oliver is being fostered in the Cedar Rapids area.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
