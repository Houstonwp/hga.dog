Up Font, known as Up N Front in his racing days, was quite a good racer and will turn five in March.  Up Front has an incredibly soft coat that could easily be mistaken for for the fur of a teddy bear.  He is doing well adjusting to retirement.  He loves toys and car rides and just being where people are.  He is fully housebroken and is doing well living with three other greys.  Up front is very social ant not at all shy or nervous in new situations.  He would make a wonderful addition for a home without small animals.  
 

  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Up Front at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
