Introducing Lil Bitty (Boc's Lil Bitty) her name is an apt. description, this little girl is just 60lbs of adorable. 

Lil Bitty is one of the sweetest and friendliest pups around. She's extremely affectionate, and loves people. Her tail doesn't stop wagging when she's getting attention, and often wags in anticipation of attention. She even wags her feet when she's rolling over for belly rubs. 

Lil Bitty adores children, but because she's rather intensely affectionate she would be best with children who are about 7-years or older.

Lil Bitty walks very nicely on leash, and rides well in the car. She sleeps quietly at night, and will give you a joyful greeting when you begin to stir in the morning. 

She did well with the cat, and gets along with the other greyhounds in her foster home. She has not been tested with small dogs.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
