Here is LW's Bundy, born 10-6-2008. Bundy is a beautiful black boy! He came off the track on 6-18-11 and is learning about retired life. He kennels well and is a pro with the stairs. Bundy loves his squeaky toys and loves to play. And as you can see......he thinks lilies make a nice bed! Bundy is not cat safe but may be small dog safe depending upon the breed. He is being fostered in Sioux Falls, SD and gets along great with kids (a 6 year old and an 11 year old) as well as two other greyhounds. You have to meet this beauty!

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
