Here is the greyhound that you have been waiting for!  This affectionate little girl goes by the name Biscuit.  She is formally known as Tyville Biscuit and she is about 2 years old.  She is such a friendly gal you could nickname her "the shadow" because of her striking black coat and her need to be at your side wherever you go. She would be a great companion for somebody who is home most of the time.

She plays well with others meaning she is cat and small animal safe.  She also enjoys the company of other greys.  House trained and crate trained means that she is fully equipped to move right into your home. Biscuit is a curious gal, exploring and snooping into anything that looks interesting.  She is available and waiting for you to fall in love with her.  One look into her eyes and you will be hooked.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Biscuit at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.


The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
