Here is Monty!  Monty is a beautiful shiny boy who will turn 4 in October.  Monty is doing very well in his foster home with 4 other greys, a miniature schnauzer and our 4 year old daughter.  We are calling Monty "cat correctable." He shows some interest in cats but can be distracted/corrected. Monty loves his toys!  He kennels well and is doing great at being out overnight.  Monty is currently living in Omaha and would love to meet you.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Monty at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
