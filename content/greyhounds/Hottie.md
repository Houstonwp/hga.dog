Miss Hottie (AStarSmoken Hot) is a flashy red brindle female who never raced. She turned three in February, and is still a big puppy at heart with puppy enthusiasm. Hottie would do well in a home where she is loved and given a lot of attention. She would be a wonderful addition to your family. She's the best Greyhound watchdog we've ever fostered!  After nearly a year in a foster home, she is ready to move to her forever home.



If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Hottie at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
