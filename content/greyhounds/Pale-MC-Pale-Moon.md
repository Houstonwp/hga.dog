This is MC Pale Moon or better known as Pale. He is a mild mannered 3 year old who just stopped racing in May 2012. In his foster home, he quickly earned the nickname "Van Gough" referencing his missing right ear. It is adorable to watch him perk his one ear up at attention when he hears a noise or sees something outside. No word on the cause of his uni-ear, but rumor has it that it was the result of a gust of wind that took it off as he was blazing to victory on the track. Pale is cat and small animal safe, living with both in his foster home. He loves toys and usually completes his play session by hoarding several toys in his crate. His friendly personality and dark brown eyes will melt your heart. Pale deserves a home full of love and companionship. Greyhounds are the perfect pets and Pale may be the perfect greyhound. Act fast because Pale will not be on this website long. He may be the pet you have been waiting for.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
