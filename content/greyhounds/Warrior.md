My name is Warrior and people tell me Iâm a striking guy. I have a beautiful dark brindle coat with white socks on all my feet, a white tuxedo marking on my chest and a slight white spot on the end of my nose. Iâm 3Â½ years old and I was a good racer until one day I just wouldnât run anymore, so now Iâm having lots of fun in retirement. I was pretty quiet when I first came off the track, but Iâm definitely catching onto the concept of playtime. Now I have fun tossing around stuffed toys and I really like to gnaw on chewbones. I live in foster care with another Greyhound and a Jack Russell terrier, and I get along well with them both. Iâm a big guy â I weigh about 75 pounds and I just came off the racetrack â but Iâm gentle and loving. Pick me! Pick me!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Warrior at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
