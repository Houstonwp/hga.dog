This is Bart's Elmo, sometimes called Tickle Me Elmo at the track.  He turned 3 in July '07.   Elmo has had some seizures but recently has been doing well on medication.   The medication is fairly inexpensive and he will probably need to stay on it indefinitely.


Elmo is a very gentle, loving dog who really likes  being a couch potato!   Loves to be around  people and other dogs, and doesnât appear to want to be the alpha.    He comes readily when called,  and responds to âNo!â  quickly.    He likes to gather unattended objects, such as slippers, empty milk cartons, squeaky toys,  etc., and put them in his crate.   He doesnât chew or destroy them, just likes to see  them in his crate!     Since heâs been on the phenobarbitol  he hasnât had any seizures or other health problems.



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Elmo at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
