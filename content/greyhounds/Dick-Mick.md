Dacknabit - better known as Dick, or maybe Mick, we can't decide - came in on 6/3/12. He is a nice 4 year old boy who is adjusting well. He kennels well, is good with the small dog and gets along great with other greyhounds, but we are still not sure about the kitties....... Dick is a really nice boy! He would be a good dog for a morning person - once he is up in the morning, he is ready for the day! He is currently with a foster family in North English, Iowa.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Dick at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
