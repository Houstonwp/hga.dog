This is Boo. She's a sweet little 3 yr old girl recovering from a broken leg which has been repaired with an external fixator instead of a cast. She won't really be ready for a home for a couple of months, unless you have experience with greyhounds and broken legs. She won't be out at meet & greets for a while, but if you think you're interested in her please let us know. More info soon!
If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Boo at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
