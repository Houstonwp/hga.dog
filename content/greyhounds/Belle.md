B's Jezebelle, or Belle, is a beautiful white female.  She was born on April 2, 2005 so she will be 5 in April.
 
Belle gets along great with cats, small dogs and big ones too!  She is a tiny little girl who is very good in the house and is trained very well.  She knows many commands such as "outside", "kennel", "upstairs", and "go to bed".  She sleeps through the night without a peep.  She is very playful and loves her stuffed animals.  When you talk to her, she gets so happy and is a constant tail wagger!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Belle at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
