Beau is an incredibly sweet and affectionate boy with the most beautiful amber eyes.Â  Beau has a lot of personality and has been enjoying the perks of being a retiree.Â  He loves ear rubs, being talked to, going for walks and generally being wherever his people are and watching what they are doing.Â  Beau has a beautiful black coat with and a long, white-tipped curly tail that is nearly always wagging.Â  Beau raced under the name "Goodmorningladies" and will turn four in October.Â  Beau lives with two other greyhounds currently and would likely be good as an only dog as well.Â  However, it is not thought he is cat safe


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Beau at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
