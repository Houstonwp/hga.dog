Tippy is a smaller girl, she raced at 58 pounds. She's about 4 years old (5/19/13) and such a sweetheart! She is being fostered in Ames. Tippy is currently living with another greyhound and doing well, but her foster mom thinks she would do well as an only dog, too, because then she could get all her family's attention! She loves to snuggle and get pets, and is loving squeaky toys! She showed no interest in a confident cat (aside from butt-sniffing) and was fine with a smaller dog but we did not let them try to play. Tippy is not spoken for yet, but we do have several applications waiting for dogs so she may not be around long! The best way to get in line for your new best friend is to turn in an application (find it at www.heartlandgreyhoundadoption.org) so we know the kind of dog you are looking for and can contact you when a good match comes in.

If you would like to meet this dog, please e-mail HGA at HeartlandGreyhound@outlook.com or call 515-967-6564 (please leave a message) and we will get back to you as soon as possible with more information.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
