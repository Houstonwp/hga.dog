Troy is a sweet boy who will be three in September.  Troy was a good racer, but his racing days ended when he broke his leg.  His leg is now all healed and he is looking for a loving home in which to retire.  Troy is very outgoing and loves other greys and people.  He is currently doing wonderfully living with three other greyhounds in his foster home.  He is adjusting well to retired life and is enjoying discovering squeaker toys and balls.  Troy would make a wonderful addition to a home that does not have small animals.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet a certain dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure that dog is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
