Razorsharp Cisco or just plain Cisco is a very loving and personable three year old boy.  Cisco loves our 3 year old daughter and gets along just fine with our other greyhounds and miniature schnauzer.  Cisco has had a little bit of bad luck the last year but has bounced back wonderfully!  Cisco broke his leg racing July 2010, that has healed wonderfully and doesnât prevent him from running a few laps here and there.  Cisco has also had several unexplained seizures on December 1st 2010.  After going onto medication he has had no incidents since then.  Cisco is a wonderful boy who is just looking for the right family to spend many wonderful years with.  Cisco is currently living in Omaha, NE.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
