Here's Jett! He's a beautiful black 6 yr old male who has lived in a home for a while. His family had to surrender him due to their health issues. He is kennel trained and loves it - seems like a security blanket for him. Jett gets along well with small animals and is living with a tiny dog in his foster home. He is goofy and fun-loving and just the sweetest boy! Come meet him!

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Jett at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
