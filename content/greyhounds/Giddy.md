Giddy Pepper is a tiny, beautiful brindle female.  She turned 8 in March but she is much younger at heart.  She is OK with small animals (the first picture shows her napping with her buddy, an 8-week old kitten).  Giddy walks well on a leash, she knows stairs and is adjusting to being in her crate by herself all day. She is very loving and likes to be close to her human, but she needs to go to a home without small children. Giddy is mellow when meeting other greys, although she can't quite figure out who that other dog is in the mirror!  


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Giddy at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
