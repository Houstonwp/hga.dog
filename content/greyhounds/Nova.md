Canine Casonova, or Nova for short, just turned 4 on December 7th.  Nova is loving his retirement and adapting very well to his new life.  Nova is living with his brother Nolan, a playful younger female greyhound and a noisy schnauzer and he gets along great with all of them.  He even loves being with our 9 month old daughter.  Nova likes his crate during the day and has done very well being loose at night.  He sleeps right through the night and is doing fine going outside to potty.  He does great on a leash and is very affectionate, a true Casonova at heart!  It seems that Nova would prefer the company of other dogs, but given the right family and I am sure that he would do fine soaking up all the attention on his own.

 
  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Nova at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
