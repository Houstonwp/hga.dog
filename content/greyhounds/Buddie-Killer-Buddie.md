Meet Buddie! He was very aptly named! Buddie has never met a stranger and would love to be your buddy. He really loves people, and is very outgoing.

Buddie is a a quiet boy who likes going for walks, and hanging out with his people. He doesn't play with toys much, but he does love to collect them on his bed. He'll also collect other objects he finds; but he's a careful guy and won't chew them. 

Buddie loves other dogs, and has to be placed in a home with at least one other dog. He gets along just fine with cats as well. 


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
