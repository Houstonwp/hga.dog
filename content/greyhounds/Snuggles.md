Say hello to Rido's Snuggles - she will be 7 years old in September. She has a very striking red coat and she really is a snuggle bear! She has a very calm personality.  She is the perfect companion dog because she is at your side where ever you go in the house or outside.  She is playful, responds to toys, and runs in the yard.  She knows her name and will respond when called.  Snuggles is crate trained and house trained.  She is not cat safe.  She would be perfect in an only pet home although she gets along fine with another grey and small dog in her foster home.  She seems to love kids and you can sense from her personality that she would adore the attention and affection of kids.  She seems to be most comfortable curled up next to you with her head on your lap.  She truly has earned her name of Snuggles.



If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Snuggles at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
