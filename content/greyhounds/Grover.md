Here is GV Grover, born 7-11-2006.  Grover is a BEAUTIFUL blue fawn male.  He has a striking coat and it is very soft.  He is a very calm boy who seems to get along well with the cat and a small dog.  Grover kennels well and loves having the other dogs around.  He is living with a foster family in the Sioux Falls, SD area.
 

  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Grover at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
