Introducing Zabrina! She's a lovely dark brindle girl who will be three in April. 

Zabrina is a happy and confident dog who has settled right in to her foster home. She's curious and smart, and has a tail that almost never stops wagging. Zabrina tested well with small dogs, cats, and kids.

Stay tuned for more updates as we get to know her better: 2/1/17

If you would like to meet this dog, please e-mail HGA at HeartlandGreyhound@outlook.com or call 515-967-6564 (please leave a message) and we will get back to you as soon as possible with more information. The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
