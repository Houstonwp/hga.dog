Here is Barts Zodiac, better known off the track as Zane.  Zane is 4 years old.  Zane is a beautiful brindle.  He is a very calm and sweet boy!  He is great at learning steps, taking them very slowly one at a time.  He is living with small animals, both a kitty and a small dog, and he seems to do very well with them.  He loves his kennel and sleeps through the night.  He has also been accident free and walks well on a leash.  Zane would probably do best in a quieter home, and with another pet for company.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Zane at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
