Introducing Ethan (KL's Ethan), an enthusiastic and curious two-year-old boy. This handsome guy is friendly and affectionate. He love toys, and can make anything into a toy.   Ethan wants to be a couch and bed dog, but isn't allowed as a foster, he does love hugs from his foster mom, he really likes to lean on and almost wrap himself around people. 

He really enjoys being outside. Ethan is good with other dogs. He passed his cat test, but hasn't been fostered with one. He is being fostered with young children and a German Shepherd, and doing very well with them all. 



If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
