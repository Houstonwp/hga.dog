This is Kasbah! (Rock the Kasbah) He's a big (about 85 lbs)and stunning 3 year old. He is house trained and learning his manners. Kas does well with the other dogs in his foster home but, he is NOT good with cats. He's a very affectionate boy who will nudge his head under your hand or arm to be petted. He loves to play with stuffed toys and chew on bones. Due to his size, Kasbah would be better around older children. He is learning to sit on command. Unlike many greyhounds, Kasbah has energy. He would be a good companion for a jogger or active person. He would love to play with another large and active dog. We are recommending a fenced yard for him. 


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Kasbah at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
