Hannah is a sweet 9 year old female.  She has been living in a home for years, so she already knows the ropes of being a pet.  All she wants is a family, a soft bed, and a few walks for her golden years.  She has done well as an only pet.  Hannah loves to lean on you while you pet her, she loves walks, and she has the energy of a much younger dog. She is a sweetheart! 


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Hannah at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $175. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
