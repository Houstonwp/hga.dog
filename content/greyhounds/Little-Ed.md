This is Little Ed â his racing name was RJ's Pear and heâs 4 years old. Little Ed is a beautiful black male who is mellow, mild mannered and good natured. He is good about going in the kennel and is house trained while out of the kennel. Little Ed needs quiet sleeping spots where he won't be disturbed unexpectedly. Â Come meet Little Ed - his black coat looks like silk!

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
