Never (or Neve) is 9 years old and finished a full career as a racer and mama dog.  She is sweet, loving and affectionate and enjoys her play time/petting time just as much as her nap time.  Neve is living with and enjoying the company of a cat and two male greyhounds in her foster home.  She kennels well and will lay down pretty much anywhere you toss her bed.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Never at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
