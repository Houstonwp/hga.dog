Here's Greg, known at the track as Racedfortheprize. He's a 2 year old boy who's living with another greyhound and a cat at his foster home. Greg is just off the track so retired life is very new to him - he currently seems like he may do best in a home where he has another dog for company. He loves his people, toys, and other dogs. He also loves his bed and sleeps through the night! Greg is taking anti-seizure medication due to some seizures he had at the track, but he has had none recently. We're not sure if this is a temporary condition. We are sure he is a sweetie who will be a wonderful dog for a lucky family!



If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Greg at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
