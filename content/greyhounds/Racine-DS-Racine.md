Racine is feeling festive even though he's recovering from surgery for his broken leg. HGA is accepting donations to help pay for his surgery and follow-up, which is estimated to run about $4,000 total. If you would like to help out this 3 yr old sweetheart, you can use the Sponsor Me button here to donate, or go to the HGA home page (www.heartlandgreyhoundadoption.org) and click on the Paypal tab on our header. You can also mail checks (PO Box 342, Bondurant, IA 50035) and we can even arrange to take a credit card if we need to. Just contact us!

Racine is not ready for adoption yet, but for future reference: the adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
