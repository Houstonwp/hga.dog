Meet Rufina (Killer Rufina) a little three-year-old girl with a killer personality. Sheâs friendly, outgoing, and easy to train.  She absolutely goes to pieces anytime someone pays attention to her.  Sheâs a huge cuddler. Huge!!!  Did I mention sheâs a huge cuddler???

Rufina loves to go for walks, and may be a candidate for a running companion (with the proper buildup). She is good in the house without being crated, and will whine and pace when she needs to go potty. She sleeps through the night well.

She loves everyone she comes across, but most especially loves children. Follows them around like they are the best thing ever!  May be a good candidate for a household with kids.

She initially tested well with small animals. 

The only "naughtiness" she gets up to is getting on the furniture where fosters are not allowed, and gives the saddest face ever when she is told to get down. She's also a bit of a cheese addict, will do anything for cheese.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
