See (Like What I See) is currently hanging out with two greyhounds and a cat waiting to find his forever home.  He is a well mannered 3 year old that understands the occasional "no" and seems to catch on and understand rules quickly.  He is affectionate, playful and a favorite among friends and guests who visit.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
