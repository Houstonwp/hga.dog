Meet âStarz Jamboreeâ or Jam for short.  He is a wonderfully mannered male who will turn 4 in August.  Jam is fitting in just fine with other greyhounds, a miniature schnauzer and our 15 month old daughter.  Jam has had no accidents in the house and is crate trained.  We feel that he would do just fine as an only dog or a companion to others.  Jam loves to go on walks and loves to meet people at the pet store.  He is affectionate and is just a very nice dog.  Jam is currently living in Omaha NE and would love to meet you!  


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Jam at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
