Fred is a beautiful red male with a black face and ears.  Fred just turned 3 the end of April.  He is fine with our min schnauzer, 4 greyhounds as well as our 3 year old daughter.  Fred kennels just fine and is a very quiet boy.  Fred might be a little shy at first but there really is a personality inside that is just waiting to come out!  Fred is currently living in Omaha, NE.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Fred at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
