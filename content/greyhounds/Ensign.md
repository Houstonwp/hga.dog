Meet Insinuated - better known off the track as Ensign.  His date of birth is 11-16-2007.  Ensign is a black beauty!  He will play with a tennis ball for hours!  He has lots of energy (for a greyhound) and might enjoy being a running companion or giving agility a try.   Ensign has been a great foster, and gets along well with the other greyhounds, but he is not safe with cats or small dogs. He kennels well, but loves the comfortable dog bed that he can rest in.  He is good on stairs, taking them slow and steady, and he is learning how to sit! What a smart boy!



If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Ensign at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
