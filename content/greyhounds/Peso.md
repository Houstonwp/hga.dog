Meet Peso Little!  Peso is a beautiful brindle boy who will turn 5 the 10th of September. Peso just retired from Bluffs Run in August. He kennels very well and sleeps through the night. He responds to his name and commands very well. He does best around other dogs and we feel he is cat safe/correctable. He has no problems with stairs and will eat whatever is in front of him. Peso is just learning how to play fetch and loves to play with rope toys. Very loving boy who might come off as shy but will quickly warm up to his new surroundings. 


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Peso at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
