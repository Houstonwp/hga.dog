Abby is a 6 month old female greyhound puppy currently staying in the Omaha area.  Her foster mom says Abby is a pro at walking on a loose leash and riding in the car.  She is also pretty good at stairs--she actually takes them slow instead of trying to jump them all.  She LOVES to cuddle!  Abby is very relaxed in new situations and when meeting new dogs and people.  She plays well with others and is completely disinterested in the cats.  She is currently working on "come", "sit" and "down". 


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Abby at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
