Jasper (Spot On Fearless) is a wonderful, happy three-year-old boy. Heâs a real lover who likes hugs and cuddles, but isn't pushy or demanding about it. He very much enjoys basking in the sun out in the yard and being outside. Jasper loves to go for walks.

Heâs had no accidents in the house, and has picked up on home life very quickly. Heâs quiet when left alone, after a couple whines; and gives a single excited bark when his foster people return home. He has been left loose in the house, and has caused no trouble.

Jasper is being fostered with another greyhound and an Italian Greyhound, heâs doing well with both. He does well with adults and children. Jasper tested well with a cat.



If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
