This is Holland Sand - better known as Sandy!  Sandy will be 2 years old in December.  She is a little shy right now,  but curious.  Sandy is very sweet and kept wanting to put her head on the driverâs shoulder on the ride home from the track!  She is doing well in foster care and did well with a small dog.  Sandy is living with a foster family in the Sioux Falls area.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Sandy at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
