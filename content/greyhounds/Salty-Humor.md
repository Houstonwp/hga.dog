Salty Humor is a sweet 4 year old.  He has a very easy going temperment and loves affection.  He has learned stairs well, resides peacefully with a cat 
and a child (9 years old) and is very open to some love from whomever might be handy!  He is working on adapting to life off the track but he seems lonesome for his dog companions.  He may do best in a household with another dog but this concern being worked on.  Salty Humor's brother Dan was recently adopted in the Omaha area.



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Salty Humor at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
