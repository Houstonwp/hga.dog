Introducing Izzy - her racing name was Barts Dramaqueen!  She is a precious female who will be two in October.  She is living with other greyhounds and kitties and is doing fine.  She is learning life after the track and is adapting very well.  Izzy seems to wag her tail when she sees children.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Izzy at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
