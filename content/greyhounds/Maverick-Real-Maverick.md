Real Maverick is really just a pup at 23 months old- but at 80lbs he's a pretty big baby! But don't worry, because this big dog has the sweetest, gentlest, most laid-back personality you can imagine. Maverick is also a very handsome boy. His beautiful black face is quite stunning with his lovely red coat.

Maverick is doing well in a foster home with smaller dogs and cats. He's quiet and relaxed in his crate while his foster parents are at work. He enjoys going for walks, big soft beds, playing with toys (he'll hoard them- taking them all to his bed and crate), and running laps in the yard with the resident whippets. But most of all, he loves people and is always looking for an opportunity to cuddle! Is this gentle giant for you?

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
