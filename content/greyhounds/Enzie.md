Say hello to Enzie!  She's a pretty fawn female who just turned 7 in July.  Enzie is looking for the perfect spot to retire and she thinks it might be in your house.  Come meet her!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Enzie at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
