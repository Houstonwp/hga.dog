Say hello to Pal! If you can't tell from his name, this is a very friendly guy! He loves to follow you around in search of attention and petting of any sort. He is happy to give face kisses in return for the affection! For a greyhound, he can be pretty energetic, so a good run/walk, or fenced backyard would be ideal. 

This dapper gentleman (His tux is included with his adoption ;) ) is also quite intelligent; he could be performing tricks in no time. He's already picked up on the concept of fetch with his favorite squeaky pig.

Pal gets an A+ in stairs, small dogs, leash walking, and lenolium. He might pull a little if he really has to go potty after being in his kennel all day. Pal is a potty pro, so long as you stick to his schedule. He needs to be let outside a half hour from when he ate or drank, and he will be just fine. 

Pal is being fostered in Omaha in an apartment, and doing well with it.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
