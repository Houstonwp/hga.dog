Say hello to Dow! He is a beautiful black brindle boy who just turned 4 on February 11, 2012.  He tested well with a cat and a small dog, he kennels well, and seems to be adjusting quickly to retired life. Dow is being fostered in the Cedar Rapids Area

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
