Wilbur, who was known as Wilbur Who on the track, is a very sweet and affectionate boy who will be four in February.  Wilbur has a beautiful black coat with white tipped toes.  Wilbur loves to be with people and is a great snuggler.  Wilbur is learning to play with toys and do stairs.  He does well with other greys and small animals.  


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Wilbur at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
