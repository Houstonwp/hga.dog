Willy is a wonderful, newly retired 5 year old boy. He is such a happy guy, smiling and wagging his tail every time sees you. He is very loving and friendly with everyone, gives great leaning hugs, just wants to be close to you. He's mastered the stairs, perfected the search for the softest bed and likes to greet you with a little roo when you come back into the room. He's very easy to live with - gets along great with the 3 other greyhounds in his Omaha foster home but loves his people most of all. Willy is NOT cat safe.

This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
