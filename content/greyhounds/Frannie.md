This is Frannie, bornÂ 9-14-07.Â  Frannie is a quiet, mellow girl. She is very well-behaved and loves any kind of attention you give her. The cutest thing about her is that anytime you start talking to her she starts thumping her tail. Frannie's foster mom says Frannie just started smiling and it is cracking them up!  She is staying in a home with two other greyhounds and two kids ages 5 and 10 and is getting along fine. She has mastered the stairs. Loud noises donât seem to be a problem. Weâre still learning about Frannie but more of her personality is starting to show through every day. A real sweetheart!Â Â She will be staying in the Sioux Falls area.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meetÂ Frannie at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
