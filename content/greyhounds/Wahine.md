Meet Wahine, or Delray Wahine in his racing days.  He is a very striking 4 year old and is learning how to live the retired life.  Wahine is getting along just fine with two males and a female greyhound.  He is also learning to live with a Miniature Schnauzer.  Wahine kennels well and sleeps right through the night.  He has had no accidents in the house and is learning how to do steps.  He enjoys soaking up attention and being with other hounds, but I feel that he would do fine as an only dog given the right family.  Wahine would love to meet you!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Wahine at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
