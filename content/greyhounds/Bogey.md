Meet Bogey (GV Boog Face at the track), a nice 3 year old boy who is ready for retirement!  He is living with a small dog, is doing the stairs well, and is quite a tail wagger!  Bogey loves his kennel! He is a silly boy with lots of personality, but he is not good with cats!


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Bogey at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
