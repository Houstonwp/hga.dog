Pass is a gorgeous, big, black boy with a sweet disposition. He's a Christmas baby who turned 4 on December 27, 2014. He has a shiny black coat and loads of personality !!! Pass loves the toys and  will play fetch with you . Pass is always on the go and hoards anything he thinks is a toy including my purse!  Pass is ready for a home now and can do steps and wood floors. He loves his large dog friends and sleeps well in his kennel or right by your bed . If you are a dedicated walker he would be perfect for you! Pass is obsessed with my cat so a cat  free home would be best.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
