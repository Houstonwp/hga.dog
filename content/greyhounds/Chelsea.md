Here is pretty girl Chelsea!  She knows and loves her name!  She comes darting towards you with her tail wagging whenever called!  She is 5 years old and good with small animals. Â Chelsea has lived in a home for a while and was returned through no fault of her own, so she will fit right in with your family!Â 


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Chelsea at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
