Barts Palisade, better known as Peyton is a beautiful brindle boy!  He is a good boy who is living with other greyhounds and a small dog and is doing fine.  He knows the routine and is a very quiet boy.  Peyton would do better with older respectful children.  He is also good around the kitties.  Peyton seems to bond quickly with men, but would do fine with females too.  He has had no accidents in the house and is a very trustworthy greyhound to have in your home.  Peyton will be 4 on 3-31-10. 


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Peyton at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
