This is Red Brick, better known in retirement as Badger.  He is 3 1/2 years old.  He is a beautiful, striking boy with lots of love to give.   He loves to play with toys!  Badger is pretty strong, has lots of energy, and is not good with cats.  We think he would do fine in a home either with or without other pets.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Badger at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
