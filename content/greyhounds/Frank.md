Say hello to Frank (previously known as Dingle Boy).  He will be 4 years old this year.  If you are looking for a boy with personality you need to look at Frank!  He has personality plus and is a joy to have around.  He is living with a small dog and he is doing fine.  He loves to be brushed and petted.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
