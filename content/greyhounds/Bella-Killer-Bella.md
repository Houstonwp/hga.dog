We think this four year old, red fawn beauty is a golden retriever trapped in a greyhound's body! Bella is a very happy, enthusiastic, outgoing dog who seems to love everyone she meets. She likes meeting new people so much that the first few nights in her foster home she'd run up to the TV, wagging, every time a person's face appeared on the screen! Bella likes to play with toys, is learning to live with cats, and gets along greyt with a pair of whippets in her foster home. She does well in her kennel, and has had no accidents in the house. She walks nicely on a leash and enjoys frolicking in the yard. Bella adores attention of any kind, but she especially loves ear and neck rubs. Looking to add some joy to your life? This is your girl!

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
