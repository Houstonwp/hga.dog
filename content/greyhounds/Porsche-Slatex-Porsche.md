Introducing Porsche (Slatex Porsche), a gorgeous golden lady. Porsche will turn 9 on March 16th.

Hi! Iâm a 9 year old racing greyhound momma with an adorable smile.  I like squeak toys, wallowing in the grass, and following my foster Dad around the house.

I get along with small dogs and I think cats are a little scary. 

Foster Dad says Iâm pretty and I have a cute curly tail like an upside down question mark.  Iâm looking for my forever home. Can I come live with you?  Iâm kennel trained, will sleep on a blanket on the floor, and have had no accidents in the house.  Hope to meet you soon!

If you would like to meet this dog, please e-mail HGA at HeartlandGreyhound@outlook.com or call 515-967-6564 (please leave a message) and we will get back to you as soon as possible with more information. The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $200. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
