Katie - Katie is two years old and a beautiful blonde.  She likes to run sprints in the yard and looks forward to going for walks.  She enjoys chew bones and fuzzy squeaky toys!  She is very affectionate and likes to be where her foster family is.  Katie does very well with the family cat, an Italian Greyhound and children.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Katie at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
