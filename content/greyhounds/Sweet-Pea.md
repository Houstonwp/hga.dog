Sweet Pea is a sweet and energetic seven and a half year old "mama dog". Sweet Pea is also a special needs hound looking for a special home. Sweet Pea has a poorly healed broken front leg. She uses the leg for balance and is getting better with using it to walk and run. Her leg doesn't stop her from chasing after her foster family's greys in the back yard! 
 

Sweet Pea is learning to go up and down carpeted steps but will need a home where she lives on a single level or with minimal steps required on a daily basis. (A first floor master bedroom would be ideal, so she can be near her people at night.) Sweet Pea gets along fine with the other greys in her foster home. She lives with two cats and is cat-correctable. Sweet Pea becomes very attached to her humans and will be a loyal and devoted companion. 


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Sweet Pea at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
