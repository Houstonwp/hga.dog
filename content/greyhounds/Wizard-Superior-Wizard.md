Superior Wizard was born on 8-27-06.  She is a beautiful light brindle female.  Wizard is a spunky girl who is adjusting to life off of the track.  She is living with another greyhound and is getting along well.  She has no trouble on any type of flooring, wood, tile, carpet and does steps quickly.  Wizard seems to enjoy her kennel and is very quiet while she is in there.  She is a curious girl who make a great companion.  She has lived with a small dog and got along fine.  She lost part of her tail in a race, but it is all healed and causes her no problems at all.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Wizard at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
