Here is Boc's RoadRage, born 6-4-2006.  RoadRage is a beautiful light brindle male.  He retired  a winner and is ready for retirement!  He has a striking coat and is settling into retirement quite well.  He does everything he is asked, does stairs perfectly, kennels well, and we have had no accidents in the kennel or in the house.  He has been a perfect gentleman.  He seems to do well with the small dog and seems to ignore the cat.  RoadRage is being fostered in the Omaha area.



If you are traveling from out of the area to meet RoadRage at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
