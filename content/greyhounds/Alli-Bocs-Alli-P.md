Alli is a beautiful fawn girl, 6 years old, and new to HGA in July 2017. She is being fostered in downtown Des Moines so is on her way to learning how to be a real city dog! We'll have more information about her soon. Alli is not spoken for yet, but we do have several applications waiting for dogs so she may not be around long! The best way to get in line for your new best friend is to turn in an application (find it at www.heartlandgreyhoundadoption.org) so we know the kind of dog you are looking for and can contact you when a good match comes in.

If you would like to meet this dog, please e-mail HGA at HeartlandGreyhound@outlook.com or call 515-967-6564 (please leave a message) and we will get back to you as soon as possible with more information.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
