Brainy Act has aÂ happy-go lucky personality andÂ loves to run circles around our willow tree and play with all his dog friends. He kennels well during the day and sleepsÂ by the side of our bed all night. BrainyÂ is housetrained and has shown no aggression toward our cat.Â Brainy is a dog that would enjoy just about any adventure you take him on. He will be 4 years old in August '13.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Brainy at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
