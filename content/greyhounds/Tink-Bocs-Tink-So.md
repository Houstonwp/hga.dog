Tink (Boc's Tink So) is an almost painfully sweet little 18 month old girl who loves petting, and will poke you with her paw if you dare to stop petting her. 

From the first night she's slept solidly, and caught onto the household routine easily. She's had no potty accidents and is a cheerful and happy dog.

Tink tested well with a cat, but has not yet met any small dogs.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
