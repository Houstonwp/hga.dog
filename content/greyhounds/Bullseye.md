Here is Boc's Bullseye, born March 2, 2006.   Bullseye is just off the track (early June) and ready for retirement!  His retirement is well-earned as he was the winner of the 2008 Iowa Breeder's Classic and many other races!   Bullseye is a big boy who is adjusting well to life off the track and seems to be pretty laid back.  He has a nice dark brindle coat, and has tested well with a small dog.  We are not sure yet if he will be able to live with a cat.  Bullseye is very quiet in his kennel and has been a well behaved greyhound for the foster family.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Bullseye at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
