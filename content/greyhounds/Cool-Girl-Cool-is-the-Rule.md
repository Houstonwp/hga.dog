Cool Girl is a 10 year old sassy senior! She may be a little white around the edges but her perky sweet personality will steal your heart.Cool Girl already knows the ropes of home living and is being fostered with 2 large dogs and a cat.She loves car rides and walks .She kennels well during the day and sleeps by our bed at night.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Cool Girl at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $200. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
