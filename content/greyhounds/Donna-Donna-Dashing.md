Meet Donna! This cute little gal will be turning three in March. She's a happy girl who loves to smile. Donna is petite at just around 57 pounds. She enjoys squeaky toys and kennels easily.

Donna is the homecoming queen of greyhounds. Not only is she an attention getter with her lovely brindle and white markings, she's got a beautiful personality too! When she isn't sleeping, she is by your side asking for pets, neck scratches, and general affection. Every once in awhile she will show off her playful side by tossing a toy up to herself, and chasing after it. She gets along well with the resident small dog and is living in an apartment,

By far her most quirky feature is her smile. After any amount of absence she loves to great you with her happy dance, and a big toothy smile! It may look scary at first, but it will be sure to give you fits of laughter after you get over the initial shock! Bring this queen into your home today, and she will surely treat YOU like royalty.

Donna is being fostered in Omaha.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
