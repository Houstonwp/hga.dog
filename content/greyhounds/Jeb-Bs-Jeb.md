Meet Jeb, (B's Jeb) 

Jeb says, "I was a greyt racer. I ran 73 times and finished in the money in half of them. I was so good that when Bluffs Run closed I got to go to Florida for a few months. I turned three December 1st. My interests are food, treats, comfy beds, marshmallows, and treats. I weigh 77 pounds and am solid muscle. Even my front legs have a six-pack. I live with two other hounds, a Shiba Inu, and a cat. I'm friendly with the cat, but the cat doesnât like me (probably because I eat his food).

I'm super friendly, like attention, and give greyt hugs. I am looking for my forever home & would love to meet you. Bring treats!"




If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
