Serena is a former mama dog who will be 10 in January, but she certainly doesn't act her age!  She still often acts silly, likes to run in circles or stretch her legs out periodically, enjoys walks and likes to greet you at the door!  She gets along well with a cat and elderly Italian Greyhound and loves attention from children and from anyone else who looks her way. Serena definitely likes to snuggle when the opportunity presents itself.  She doesn't look her age either and although she likes to know what is going on at her foster home she is happy to settle down and take a good nap.  Serena is mom to several dogs HGA has recently adopted out - Donna, Sweetie, Kenzie, Maddie and Ali.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Serena at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
