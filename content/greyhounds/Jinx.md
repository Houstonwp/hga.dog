Jinx is just a doll. Her race name is 'My Angel O' and she had a good racing career followed by a stint as a brood mama. She has perfect house manners, she doesn't steal things, chew, or counter-surf. She is a good sleeper, and will sleep in as long as you want. She has gotten along with all the dogs she has met, and seems to like kids too. She loves to snuggle and lean, and likes to be near her people, but isn't needy. She crates fine, but is trustworthy left out in the house. She had a bath and loved it, she kept going back into the bathroom and standing by the tub. She also loves to hang out in the closet and lay on laundry. She has the nicest waggly tail and is as sweet as can be. She is 8 years young.  Jinx can be sneaky - she loves trying to drink out of glasses, and will very quietly help herself if she can. She responds very well to 'no' and picks up new things fast. She has no problem with slick floors, and rides pretty well in the car. She would be fine as an only dog or with canine siblings.



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Jinx at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
