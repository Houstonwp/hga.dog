Introducing Groove (Getinmy Grooveon). This handsome two-and-a-half year old brindled boy is adjusting quickly to his new lifeâ¦relaxing and sleeping.
 
Groove rides well in vehicles, walks nicely on leash. Heâs good with the stairs on the deck, but is still working on open-backed indoor stairs. Groove is very friendly to all the people and dogs we have met on walks. Groove likes chew toys, and is not possessive of them. 

Groove allows his feet to be rubbed and makes no fuss while clipping his toe nails. He allows me to massage his teeth and gums. Unless licking the toothpaste and toothbrush is a problem, Groove has no issues with allowing his teeth being brushed. He shows no signs of food aggression, there have been no incidents of improper chewing or counter surfing. We are attempting to teach him to ring the chimes when he needs to go outside. 

Some of the commands and hand signals we are working on are Come, Stay, Wait, Walk, Stop, Down, Boundary, and Leave-it. So far Groove has shown little interest of getting up on the furniture.

At first Groove had no interest in treats but finally he is coming around. Groove loves running in the back yard. Mostly Groove desires the love and attention he deserves so much. As I write the Groove is curled up in a ball beside my chair. He likes to follow his people around, and will often lay where he can see into multiple rooms to catch all the action.
Groove is being fostered in Omaha and living with another greyhound.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
