Here's Reina!  She's a gorgeous red girl with a black muzzle and that pretty "eyeliner."  She'll be 3 years old in October.   Reina is very sweet and currently living with 2 other greyhounds and 2 cats.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Reina at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
