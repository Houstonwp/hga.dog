Stacy is two years old and very shy, but very sweet. She's soft as a bunny, doesn't have much prey drive, and gets along well with other dogs and cats. She has very nice house manners, plays quietly, and loves to run around in the yard. Stacy will need to go to just the right home - she will thrive in a quiet environment with a regular routine and will be your best buddy when you have earned her trust.


Â 

Stacy has come a long way during the past several months in foster care, but is not a dog suitable for an inexperienced owner or chaotic household, due to her introverted, skittish tendencies and personality. She will probably always display some level of fearfulness/anxiety when exposed to loud/unusual noises or other novel stimuli. But for the right individual willing to put in the time and effort to help her reach her full potential, she's a diamond in the rough!

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
