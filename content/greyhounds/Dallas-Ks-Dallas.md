Meet Dallas! He's a lovely three-year-old Blue-Fawn boy. He's finding that retirement suits him and really likes cuddling with his people. Dallas chatters his teeth when excited - see video.

He rides nicely in the car, has mastered the stairs, and isn't bothered by slick floors. He sleeps through the night without a peep. He's good around cats, and other dogs large and small. He has had no accidents in the house.

He's a playful boy who likes his toys, and would really like an adult human to roughhouse and wrestle with, he wants to engage in gentle bitey play, but that has to be discouraged while he's a foster. 

Dallas likes to follow his people around the house, and be nearby for activities. He would do well in a family with older, or quieter children. 

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
