Tyville Perfect is a littermate to Tyville Wood, also in foster care with HGA.   Perfecto, or Wally as his foster family calls him, is about 3 1/2 years old and adjusting nicely to his retirement.  He is currently living with small animals and a collie, and doing well with all the family pets.  Perfecto loves to lay around the house, go for walks, and go to the dog park!  


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Perfecto at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
