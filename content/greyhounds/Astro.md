Meet Astro! He is 5 years old and living with a foster family in the Sioux City area. Astro is a real sweetheart! He has lived with other greyhounds and also did well with a small and a medium sized dog. He seems to be OK with cats. Astro kennels well and is already doing stairs.  Astro needs a home where he will have another dog for company.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Astro at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
