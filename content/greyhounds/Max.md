Here is A Star Duramax!  Max just turned 4 this month.  He has a wonderful personality and gets along great with our hounds, min schnauzer and our 3 year old daughter.  Max would do well in an only dog home or make a perfect sibling for another dog.  Max is quiet at night, does stairs and kennels fine while we are gone.  As an added bonus upon request Max will give you a nice big greyhound hug!  He is a solid 80lbs but he is not oversized.  He is just right!

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
