Say hello to Tex Mex, aka Big Tex at his foster home. Tex Mex is a big, tall, beautiful brindle boy who is 4 years old. Heâs living with 3 other male dogs and a cat, and getting along great everybody.  No accidents in the house, doing well with stairs, and walking nicely on leash. Big Tex is just discovering toys, and is working on sit/stay. Heâs a bit shy around strangers, but warms up when he gets to know you. If you want an excellent companion for your house, Big Tex will always be by your side. He is BIG on giving kisses and being loved too.

This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
