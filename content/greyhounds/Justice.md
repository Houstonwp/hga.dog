My name is Justice and Iâm a playful, outgoing guy. Iâm nearly all black â I have just a little white on a couple of my toes and a dusting of white on my chest and chin. People say that with my shiny coat, Iâm a striking guy. 

Iâm 5 years old and I retired from the race track after a successful career that spanned multiple states. My name in the racing world was Hibest Minaki, but I think Justice is a lot simpler! 

I currently live with another Greyhound and an energetic Jack Russell terrier, and I get along with them both. I also have spent time around cats and I am friendly with them as well. My foster family sometimes calls me âThe Windmillâ because when Iâm really happy, my tail doesnât just wag back and forth, it goes around in a circle like a windmill! Iâve adjusted well to retirement and while I like to play in the yard, I think my top choice for activities is a long nap on a soft bed. Iâd love to meet you so please ask about me! 


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Justice at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
