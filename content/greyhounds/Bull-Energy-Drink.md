Say hello to Bull (Energy Drink). This four-year-old boy is a keeper! He is a very quiet laid back boy.  He LOVES to be by your side and petted. He'll walk up to you and look you straight in the eyes with a face of innocence requesting to be petted. At night, he will lay on the floor beside you quietly until it is time to get up.Once he gazes at you with his amazing eyes and you are hooked. He has such a sweet looking face and personality to go with it.

Bull does steps well. He hasn't had any accidents in the house and when he needs to go out, he paces a bit then will go and stand in front of the door.

Bull does well on his walks. He starts off pulling a bit - there is just so much new stuff to see and investigate. But after a bit, he settles in and walks nicely with you. He hasn't shown interest in toys yet - I am sure after a little time that will come. He enjoys being outside with his foster brother and sister.  When he is done playing with them he will come stand by you and watch them.

He's being fostered with a small dog and a cat, and getting along fine with both of them.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
