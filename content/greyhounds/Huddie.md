Huddie is quite the laid-back character, he loves to lounge around on his bed, even while his people are home. Though he's very happy to see someone enter the home and will gladly wag right up to visitors. He loves butting right up to people when he wants petting, getting right into your hip and leaning.He has recently shown exceptional concern for a friend of the family who was experiencing fairly severe pain, opining through headbutts that petting a greyhound is quite the painkiller.

Huddie is a bit shy when it comes to his dinner and doing his business on walks. He's not pushy about getting to his food at feeding times, but will wait until you walk away a good distance before digging in. On walks he's somewhat picky about where he places his... 'pickups', but is quite easy on the leash. He does enjoy 'prancing' or dancing out at the end of the leash as you lump around in a silly fashion.
Huddie has been quite easygoing with our two cats, being minimally inquisitive and willing to stay our of their space once they tell him so, and has been curious but avoidant of the children we encounter on walks.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
