This is Stu! He'll be 4 years old in October. Stu loves his toys, does well on carpeted stairs, and is learning about household things like glass doors and windows. He seems to be OK when meeting small dogs, but is probably not cat safe - he is very fixed on cats when he sees them. Stu may do better with another dog for company as he has had some trouble off and on adjusting to being home by himself.
If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Stu at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.
The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
