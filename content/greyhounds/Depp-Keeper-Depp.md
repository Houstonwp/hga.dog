Introducing, Depp (Keeper Depp) a fantastically charming four-year-old boy who will worm his way into your heart when you meet him. He's friendly and affectionate, and will persist in leaning on and cuddling with people he takes a liking to.

Just off the track, he powered down the steps on his first try, and although he needed a little coaching to get back up was keen to make the attempt on his own if he could just figure them out! After one swat from the resident cat he's decided kitties are not terribly interesting, and is good with the small dog too.

Think of the nicknames too! Edward Scissorpaws, Captain Black Sparrow, Gilbert Greyp!

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
