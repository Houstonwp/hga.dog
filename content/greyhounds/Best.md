Kay Tâs Best is a pretty black boy with some white markings.  Heâs a smaller male, probably around 70 pounds.  He is already doing stairs, not pulling on the leash, and getting along fine in his Sioux Falls foster home!  For those of you who have met Ella the petite, blue grey at the Sioux Falls, SD meet and greets â this is her brother! He has the same affectionate, friendly personality that she does. So if you had any interest in her (she is adopted) â Best is the next âbestâ thing!


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Best at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
