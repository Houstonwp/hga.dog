Journey is a 2 year old fawn female. She is learning her manners and all about walking on a leash.  Journey kennels well and sleeps all night. She is skittish and would benefit from a quieter family and home. Journey is working on steps and learning the in and outs of doorways - she  left the track on 8-23-14 and everything is new. She loves attention, loves to be petted and always wants to be in the same room as her people. She is currently living with another greyhound. 


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Journey at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
