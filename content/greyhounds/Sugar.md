Sugar is an 8 year old fawn female with beautiful Cleopatra eyes. She has a very youthful personality, loving to play and run. When Sugar is napping she likes to lay in the "cockroach" position (all four legs up in the air). Sugar is currently living with 3 other greyhounds, a small white fluffy dog, and a cat and is getting along well with everyone. Sugar has also been around children and has done very well with them, also. 


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Sugar at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
