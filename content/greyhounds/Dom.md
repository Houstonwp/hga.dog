Meet Domino!  Or as we call him - Dom.  He is a very playful boy who will turn 3 in July.  Dom is doing great with small dogs and children and loves all the attention you can give him.  Dom is kennel trained and working on all his home manners, he would do great with an active family as a first hound or as a happy addition to a current group.  Dom is a wonderful boy looking for a forever home!   He is currently living in Omaha, NE.



If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Dom at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
