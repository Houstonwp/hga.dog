"I'm Over Exposed" or "Exposed," or just plain "Ex" turned 4 years old in March and this high steppin' boy is ready for adoption.  He is a beautiful white and brindle.  He is living with 2 other greyhounds and 2 cats.  Ex is adjusting very well to retired life. He is very 
loving and playful and is learning to play w/ toys.



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Exposed at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
