Lobster (RJâs Lobster), who turns four in March, is a sweet, loving, mellow dark brindle girl who loves to play with everyone. She adores chewy toys, especially squeaky ones. Tough toys are best for this good self-entertainer.

Lobster loves to be with her people. She does great on stairs, and likes her crate. She is cat friendly. She gets along very well with the resident greyhound, and plays enthusiastically with him in the yard. She is living with a 4-year-old child, and doing very well with him, she accepts handling and some gentle redirection from the child. She is good on stairs, which she learned very quickly, and walks nicely on a leash.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
