Smiley (Wanton) is a velvety soft, dark brindle, three-year-old male. Smiley never raced. He is a shy boy, so his racing owner just let him spend his at the farm with all the other pups until Smiley was ready for a couch.

He was named Smiley due to his habit of lifting one lip over his teeth in a smile when heâs happy.

Smiley loves his toys - he will bring them all into his kennel. He will help you with housework by picking up things that are lying around and put them in his kennel too.

Smiley has come to love his daily walk. He doesn't pull, and barking dogs do not faze him. Heâs a little shy of strangers, but thatâs because he hasnât been around a whole lot of people yet.

Due to his shyness, Smiley would like a home with another dog to help him continue to come out of his shell. He would also do better without little kids around - he does startle with loud noises.

Heâs a wonderful, sweet boy with a lot of love to give. He did very well with his cat test.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
