HGA encourages all Greyhound owners to find a veterinarian with experience dealing with the unique veterinary needs of these dogs as they have special requirements with respect to anesthesia, flea/tick control, grooming, etc.

If you are not sure if your local veterinarian is experienced with Greyhounds, don’t be afraid to ask him/her about how many Greyhounds he has treated in the last several years or to quiz him/her about greys’ special veterinary needs.

HGA Greyhounds are initially treated (including spaying/neutering, teeth cleaning, nail trimming, vaccinations and de-worming) by Dr. Michael Henning and partners in our efforts to provide quality care for your greyhound.

When you search for a new greyhound-savvy vet, referrals from other greyhound owners or your adoption group representatives are your best resources. Everyone likes their vet for different reasons. Not every vet will match every owner’s expectations.
