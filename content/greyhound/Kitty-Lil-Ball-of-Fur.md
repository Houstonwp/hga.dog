Kitty (Lil Ball of Fur) will be 2 years old in April 2016. She is an affectionate girl, currently living with 2 other dogs and a cat. Kitty is very smart and a fast learner, ok with stairs and hard floors. Kitty is a bit shy and can be nervous in loud or hectic environments. She would make a great 2nd hound for someone in a quieter home.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
