Hereâs Condi! Condi is a very good girl currently living with a cat and a Lab. She is what we call a  "velcro" dog - she loves to be by your side! Condi is very loving and adjusting to home life well. She will need a home with a high (preferably privacy) fence or where she will be walked on leashâ she has jumped a 4 foot high chain link fence.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Condi at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
