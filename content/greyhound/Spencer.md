Spencer is a very sweet, beautiful white & brindle boy who's about 4 years old.   He's got retirement all figured out - He is crate trained and housetrained, and does very well on leash so he would be a good apartment pet.  He does fine living as an only dog, but  he wouldn't mind living with another dog and has lived with cats. He loves to cuddle up and watch TV.  Spencer does have seizures which are contolled by daily medication.



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Spencer at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
