This is Frankie, a sweet, sensitive guy. He loves his dog bed, kennels with ease, and gets along with others dogs of all shapes and sizes. He thinks rabbits are fun to watch and windows are made for looking out.Â He is curious and likes to investigate everything. Such as "what are you getting out of the drawer?", "what are you drinking?" etc. He also likes stuffed animals and will carry them around the house. He and the cat are now best buddies. Frankie will stand at the window the cat is laying in and they will watch the world scurry by. Frankie will be 4 years old in November.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Frankie at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
