"Button" will be 4 years old in October.  He is currently staying with a foster family in the Sioux Falls area.  Button loves attention. He will put his head in your lap and almost fall asleep standing up! He likes being with his people which includes two children ages 5 and 10. Heâs also living with two other greyhounds and gets along fine with them but can be independent as well.  Button has been showing some interest in smaller dogs so he may be best suited to a home with larger dogs.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Easy Button at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
