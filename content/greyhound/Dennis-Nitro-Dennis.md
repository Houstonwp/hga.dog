Hi, I am Dennis (aka Nitro Dennis). I am a 3 year old red greyhound with an awesome widows peak (my foster Mom says) and part black tail. 

I enjoy my daily walks. I don't need to go far - I just like to get out and around. If other dogs bark at me I will give them a bark back to say "Hi". I especially love it when someone walks by because I know they will pet me. I am a people dog and love when people come to visit. When the neighbors come out I rush to the fence to talk. I like someone to toss the toys for me when we are outside. Boy do I like toys!

I am currently living with two greyhounds and we get along good. I have lived with a cat before too - they are of no interest to me. I do like when the kennel door is left open throughout the day because I like to lay in there for naps. I will kennel if you tell me to "Kennel Up" and give me a treat. I am doing better in my kennel when no one is home - but I do like the company of the other dogs. 

I have been in a house before and I must say . . . I LOVE COUCHES! I like to lay on them. I even share them with the other pups. If you want to sit by me I will snuggle up and lay my head on your lap. I like to be with people. 

All I want is my own family. My foster mom says I will find them soon. She says my cute widows peak and snugly nature is hard to resist!

This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
