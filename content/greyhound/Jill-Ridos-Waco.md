Jill is a beautiful 7 yr-old girl who loves attention and a nice soft bed. She was formerly in a home for some time, so she has already knows all about the retired life. Jill gets along with dogs and children, and is cat correctable. She loves to follow you around the house and loves belly rubs. Jill kennels well and likes to lay in there - she's a real sweetie!

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Jill at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $175. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
