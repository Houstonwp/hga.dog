Introducing Twisted (P Kay Twisted). She's a little 60lb 3-year-old girl. Twisted is easygoing, quiet in the crate, sleeps through the night, and she rides well in the car. 

Twisted loves toys, gives kisses, and is an all around pleasant hound to be around. She's a wonderful and easygoing hound, who would be great in just about any family.

Twisted is being fostered with two other greyhounds and a cat. She is getting along well with everyone.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
