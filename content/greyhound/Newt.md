Meltdown Newt is a beautiful black boy with tons of personality.  He's 4 years old and very lovable.  Newt  seems to get along with small animals and loves to play and bring the toy back to you.  He is living in the Sioux City area and is living with another greyhound, a Jack Russell and children.  He is adjusting well to life off the track.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Newt at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
