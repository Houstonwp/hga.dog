Here is Imagination and what a sweet girl she is! Her foster family calls her Lana in remembrance of her former owner and she is 9 years young. She gets along well with small dogs, (she thinks they are just more puppies). Lana is not cat safe. She is a very sweet girl. Her foster mom says Lana is quiet and very well-behaved. She does stairs well and knows the regular route for her morning walk. Lana kennels well and seems to be OK as the only pet in the house. Her puppies are getting ready to start racing at Dubuque.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
