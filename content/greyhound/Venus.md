Venus is a greyhound mix (Staghound) who is estimated to be around 3-4 years old. She was picked up as a stray with no ID, attempts were made to find her owners, but were unsuccessful.

This inquisitive girl is about 50lbs. She loves to see what you are up to and enjoys a good snuggle with her people, Athena, or the resident dogs. 

She adores squeaky toys, chewing on bones, entertaining herself by tossing toys around, and âburyingâ toys in blankets or between beds. She walks well on a leash and is curious about new surroundings. She canât help but nuzzle into people and burrow into/under blankets and dog beds. 

Venus is the more vocal of the two: she pants or growls when she is excited/playing. She picks up on new commands and routines without a problem!

Weaknesses include: marshmallows, the smell of clean laundry, a good squeaky toy, and having her ears or rump scratched.

** Venus may be daughter to Athena who was picked up at the same time, and the two show an obvious bond**

If you would like to meet this dog, please e-mail HGA at HeartlandGreyhound@outlook.com or call 515-967-6564 (please leave a message) and we will get back to you as soon as possible with more information. The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
