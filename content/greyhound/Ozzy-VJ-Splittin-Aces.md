Introducing Ozzy (VJ Splittin Aces) this adorable and friendly boy was a favorite at the kennel. He even had -The Most Handsome- written on his muzzle so we would know just how special he is.

Ozzy is settling into retirement. He kennels well, but also behaves nicely if left loose. He has has no accidents in the house, and will alert you when he needs to go out.

Ozzy loves long walks, and would like to be someone's jogging partner. 

He's good around children, and seems to be afraid of cats and small dogs. 

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
