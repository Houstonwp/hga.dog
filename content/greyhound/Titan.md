Here is Flynow Titan - better known as Titan.  Titan is a beautiful black male with a white tip on his tail and white on his feet.  His date of birth is 2-09-06, so he will be 4 in February.  He is a very quiet boy as you can see in the pictures.  He loves to lay on the floor, and will just lay there and let you step over him.  He has only been retired a short time, and is catching onto life after the track quite well.  He is good with small animals and is also living with a teenager and seems to enjoy everyone's company.  He kennels well and is quiet while in the kennel.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Titan at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
