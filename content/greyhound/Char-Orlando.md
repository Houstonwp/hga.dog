Char, known as Char Orlando at the track, is a beautiful 8 year old female who is looking for a home where she can kick back and enjoy her golden years. After her racing days she had a second career raising several litters of future racers. She is very well behaved and living with another greyhound and a small dog. The cats in the house are not safe around Char but they have learned to keep their distance. She kennels well and is perfectly house trained. Stairs are not a problem for this experienced lady. There is no end to the love and affection that she has to offer. She will make a great companion pet for you and your family. Char will probably do best with older children.

The adoption fee for senior greyhounds (age 7 and older) through HGA is $175. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
