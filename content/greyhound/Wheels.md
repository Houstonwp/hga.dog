Here is Racing Wheels On - better known off the track as Wheels! He was born in November of 2007. Wheels is a lovable boy who SMILES and chatters his teeth more than any grey that we have had! He does the smiling and chattering when he gets excited. He also plays fetch! He kennels well and has a beautiful silky coat. He is small dog correctable, and does well with other dogs as well.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Wheels at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
