Drew just came off the track and is coming up on his 4th birthday. He is a very quiet, affectionate boy who loves belly rubs.  He is great on a leash and never seems to get too worked up. He is house trained and a very good listener. He is in the process of adjusting to life with cats at his foster home.  He is very good with stairs and has already learned the way home from walks.  He can sound like a fire engine when he whines, but does not ever bark.  He will be a special best friend for any lucky individual or family. 


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Drew at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
