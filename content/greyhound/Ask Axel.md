Here is Askonce!  He is 4 years old, just off the track (November), and is in the process of learning about retired life!  He tested okay with small animals, does steps, kennels well, and is living with another greyhound.  He seems to have a calm personality, and is quick to learn the routine. Askonce is very affectionate, loves the backyard and his walks, and does well on leash.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
