Meet Skye, an 11-month-old girl. This lovely little (47lbs) lady really likes her people. She is a cuddle hound, and very playful. She crates well, but will bark if she can hear but not see her people.

Skye walks very nicely on leash, rides well in the car, and adores children.  She has lived with large and small dogs. She is OK with cats, she is scared of them up close, but does like to bark at them when she can see them from a distance. She really just wants to play.

Skye is a wonderfully cuddly puppy that just needs a little polishing. She is responding very well to reward based training methods and is working on properly greeting people and basic obedience skills. She has sit, down, leave-it, and drop almost  mastered. Skye is currently living with a male and female Greyhound and gets along well with both. They even all crawled in the same kennel one afternoon for cuddles. Due to her puppy enthusiasm she might be too much for small children. Skye would love a family that will continue to be consistent in her training so she can grow into the awesome dog she has the potential to be.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
