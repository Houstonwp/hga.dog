Here is Cain -  He is 3 years old and just off the track (in September) and we are still learning about him.  He seems to be good with a small dog and we are still testing with the kitties.  He kennels well, he lays in the kennel and crosses his legs, too cute!  He is doing the stairs like a champ and is a little shy at first, but he warms up fast!   He is pretty playful and likes to play tag in the yard while barking.....I think his personality is really starting to come out!  We will post more soon!


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Cain at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
