Kiowa is a good looking brindle boy who turned 4 years old in June. He knows his name and loves attention. Kiowa is not safe with cats, but he did well when introduce to a smaller/medium size dog. As a new addition to our home, he is learning the routine quick and gets along well with our other greyhounds and Sugar Pup. 


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Kowa at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
