G-Unit, a.k.a. Vinny, is a very sweet 5 year old brindle male. Vinny is extremely affectionate once he gets to know someone. Initially, Vinny is can be scared of new people and will often bark at them while simultaneously running away. This has improved as his foster family has been working with him, but Vinny needs an adoptive home that will be patient and give him a little extra TLC to help increase his confidence with people. Vinny is an excellent walker and car passenger. He does get nervous meeting or passing people on walks and needs to be walked on a harness. He has also been doing wonderfully living with four other greyhounds in his foster home. Vinny is not cat safe. Vinny has some separation anxiety and would do best in a home with another dog so he is not entirely alone when his family is at work.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Vinny at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
