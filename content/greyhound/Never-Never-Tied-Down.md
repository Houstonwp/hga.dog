Miss Never is a beautiful 4 year old girl who is playful and cat-friendly. 
She kennels well, sleeps through the night, and has not had any accidents 
in the house.  She loves to go on walks and is good on leash, but should probably not be walked by children because she can get a little excited about squirrels and such. Although Miss Never is tolerant of her foster mom's attempts to dress her up, she's going to have to work on hiding her dismay with hats and snoods if she wants to be a supermodel.

This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
