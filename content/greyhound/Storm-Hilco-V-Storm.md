Introducing Storm (Hilco V Storm) a fun and friendly gal who just turned eight in May.

Storm is very affectionate, and really loves people. She adores being petted, which is good because her fur is addictively soft, you almost can't help but keep petting her. She loves cuddles, and gives kisses.

She's easygoing, loves her crate, good on walks, and rides well in the car. Storm can get along with other animals large and small, but if she's around cats they must be confident and outgoing cats, she will want to chase a skittish cat. 

Storm would be an excellent dog for a first-time owner!

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $200. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
