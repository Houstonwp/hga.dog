This is Sam!  He's a gorgeous boy who will be 2 years old in November and he is "small animal correctable."    Sam seems a little shy to start out but he is learning more about retirement every day!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Sam at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
