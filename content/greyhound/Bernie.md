October 26, 2004:  Bernie is officially lookin' for love and ready to find a home as special as he is.   He's busy learning to run and play off-leash and making up for the time lost during his recovery when he had to be such a good boy!    (The photo taken on the deck is "before," the photo taken on the grass is "after.")   Contact HGA for more information if you are interested in Bernie.


Background:  Bernie is a sweet greyhound pup who suffered an injury to a growth plate in his leg when he was little.  He had two surgeries to correct the problem at the Iowa State University Veterinary School.  The surgeries were a success and the leg is completely healed & strong, although it is still a bit odd looking.  Bernie and HGA thank the generous donors who helped pay for his vet care.  Without their help, Bernie may not have had a chance to enjoy the couch potato life he deserves.
