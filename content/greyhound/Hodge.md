Hodge is a friendly, gentle Greyhound that gets along well with other Greyhounds, cats and small dogs. Heâs a big, handsome guy, weighing in at about 85 pounds. Heâs mostly white with a few brown spots and a brown patch around his ears. Hodge turned 6 in February.  


Hodge was known as RNR My Hog Dog at the race track, where he was a big winner. During his racing career, he finished in first, second or third (win, place or show) in more than 60 percent of his races. Now that heâs retired from the track, he loves nothing more than a long nap and to have his neck scratched! We think Hodge will do best with another dog for company.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Hodge at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
