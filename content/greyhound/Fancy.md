Fancy (Serena's Fancy) is a beautiful white and fawn female who will be 2 in March.  She is small animal safe and is living with other greyhounds and a cat.  She is a sweet girl!



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Fancy at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
