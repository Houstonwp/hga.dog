Gordo has a birth date of 12/12/12, and he just turned three.

Gordo is a very handsome 3 year old brindle boy. He's a lover and a cuddler. Nothing makes him happier than an ear rub, back end scratch, or a snuggle. Right away we noticed his friendliness- his tail is always wagging and he's always got a curious look on his face. He's explored every inch of the house and doesn't seem to be too afraid of anything new. Today we introduced the vacuum. It was a little scary but mostly an intriguing new experience.  So far Gordo has mastered the front and back steps, seems to know that outside is the place for potty, and has proven to be pretty correctable. He REALLY wants to be allowed on the couch so he has requested a home with dog-friendly furniture.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
