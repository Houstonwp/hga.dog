This is Superior Diva.  She just came off the track July 10, 2009.  Diva is a pretty brindle girl who is living with a small dog and other greyhounds.  We are still testing with the kitties, but she will probably be fine once she fiqures out what they are.  Diva is good in the kennel and is learning stairs, and is doing fine.  She will be 2 years old July 24, 2009.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Diva at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
