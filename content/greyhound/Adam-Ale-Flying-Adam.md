Here is Adam, AKA Ale Flying Adam. Heâs a pretty fawn boy who was born September 11, 2008 â he just turned 4 and heâs ready to retire! Adam is learning the house rules, stairs, and getting along with the other two dogs at his foster home. He does not appear to be safe with small dogs or cats. Adam is being fostered in the Omaha area.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
