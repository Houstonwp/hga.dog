Lizzy (aka Sara), who raced under the name Slatex Sara Liz, is a 10 year old mama dog who is looking for a forever home. Lizzy needs someone who can give her a little extra TLC to help her learn how to trust and help her come out of her shell. She has already made a lot of headway. She loves going for walks and car rides and having her ears rubbed. Lizzy has a beautiful and extremely soft brown / black coat that feels like that of a stuffed animal. Lizzy is not thought to be small animal safe.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Lizzy at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $225. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
