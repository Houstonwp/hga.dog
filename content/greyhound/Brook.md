Brook is about 2 years old.  She's a cutie - look at that smile!  She is currently living with another greyhound and a dachshund and adjusting nicely to retirement.  Brook has learned her house manners well. She is house broken, and well behaved. Brook does well with children and would be a wonderful member of your family.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Brook at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
