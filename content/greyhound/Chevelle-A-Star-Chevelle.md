Introducing Chevelle (A Star Chevelle). This lovely girl is an 8 year old retired brood mama. She's very affectionate, and loves to follow you around for all the petting she can get.

She's a sweet, and happy girl who enjoys a good romp around the yard, especially if there is a rabbit to chase.

Chevelle is good with other dogs, and she passed her cat test with ease. She was interested enough to give the cat a sniff, but that was all she wanted.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $200. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
