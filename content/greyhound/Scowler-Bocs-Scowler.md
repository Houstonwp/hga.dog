Scowler is a sweet almost 4-year old girl who is not at all scowly!  Scowler had to have all her teeth removed due to a possible immune reaction involving her teeth. This does not affect her ability to eat at all and is not a reflection of her general health - the main result is that her tongue tends to flop out of her mouth! Even without teeth, Scowler is not cat safe! 

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
