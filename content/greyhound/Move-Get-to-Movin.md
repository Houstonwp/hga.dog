Introducing Move (Get to Movin) - Move is a 72lb boy who will turn 4 in November.

" My name is Get To Movinâ.  I am a 3 year old male looking for my forever home.
I live with 2 other greyhounds, a Shiba Inu, and a cat.  I am afraid of the cat.

I am starting to play with toys but donât have a favorite yet.

I like to learn & get excited when I do.
When I had to go down the carpeted stairs I was really scared,
but after we got back from the vet, I did it three more times just for fun."

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
