Chester would make a perfect spring or summer dog. The problem is that it is winter and this energetic three year old male( September) needs a 20 minute walk to take the edge off. If you can handle putting on your gloves, putting on his coat and getting him around the neighborhood for January and February, the dividends will be great. He is young. He will lose his young dog enthusiasm. He is a sweet dog now but in a year he will be worth every walk in the cold. He is currently living in the Omaha area with a cat which he ignores, a foster grey and two resident greys.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Chester at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
