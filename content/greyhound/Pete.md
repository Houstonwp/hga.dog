This is the very handsome and charming Pete (aka Hilltex Pepsi), who will be 4 in September.  He is taking in all the new things in life like stairs, toys, dog beds, waiting until the glass door is open before exiting/entering and everything else that comes with greyhound retirement.  He is a very quick learner and seems to be enjoying himself every step of the way.  Pete is shy when he first meets you but his personality, charm, eagerness to learn and happy attitude is very addicting.  Pete is living in a foster home with two greyhounds and a cat.  He tested fine with a small dog and seems to be curious but ok with cats.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Pete at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
