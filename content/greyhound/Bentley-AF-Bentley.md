Say hello to AF Bentley! He's a gorgeous brindle boy, 4 years old. He seems to be pretty easy-going and showed no interest in a small dog. Bentley is being fostered in the Omaha area and we'll have more info soon!

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Bentley at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present. Beginning July 1, 2014, the adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
