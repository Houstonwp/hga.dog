Lily, who raced under the name J's Igotyourbooty, is a seven year old girl who was a mama dog before becoming fully retired.  Lily is extremely sweet and does fabulously with the other two greyhounds with whom she lives.  She has a beautiful caramel swirled brindle coat and big brown eyes.  Lily is doing great adjusting to retired life.  She love to play with toys that rattle and has a curious nature.  She loves head and ear rubs and being with people.  Lily is fully housetrained and does not use a kennel.  Lily is missing two toes on her back left foot.  Because of this, Lily cannot be a walking or jogging companion, but she is a wonderfully sweet house companion.  

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Lily at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $175. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
