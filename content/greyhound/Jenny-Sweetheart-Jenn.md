Sweetheart Jenn (nickname Jenny) is a playful and affectionate 4 year old female. She is a beautiful fawn color with gorgeous eyes. She likes going for walks, enjoys treats and loves playing with her dog toys. She gets along well with cats, small dogs and young children. She has already settled in nicely with her foster family (quietly sleeping at night & house/kennel trained). Jenny is looking for her forever home. Jenny raced at about 63 pounds and is being fostered in the Des Moines area.

If you would like to meet this dog, please e-mail HGA at HeartlandGreyhound@outlook.com or call 515-967-6564 (please leave a message) and we will get back to you as soon as possible with more information.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
