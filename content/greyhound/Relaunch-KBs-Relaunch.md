Relaunch is a fun young greyhound looking for a home that will provide him love, attention and a tremendous amount of toys.  He has come to be known as Eddie around his foster home.  Eddie is short for Fast Eddie, which is the nickname he has earned for the sneaky way he hoards all the dogs toys in the house.  He loves to play and frolic.   Eddie crates well but also loves the feel of a thick comfy dog bed.  He currently lives in a foster home with cats, a small dog and two other greys.  Because he loves attention so much, a home where he is the sole pet may be preferred but not necessary.  He is frequently found carrying his toys outside or rearranging them in his crate.  This black greyhound is very striking with his white feet and tip of his tail that looks like it has been dipped in a can of paint.  He will turn four years old in May. Eddie (Relaunch) deserves your love and a home he can call his own.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
