Harvey is 2 years old, a nice small brindle male about 65 pounds. He loves his kennel, is doing well with house training, and goes up and down stairs. He is doing well living with another greyhound but has not been tested with small animals. Harvey may take a little while to warm up when he first meets you, but is a real sweetie when he gets to know you!

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Harvey at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
