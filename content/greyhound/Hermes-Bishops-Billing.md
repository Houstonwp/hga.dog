Introducing Hermes (Bishops Billing) a charming 7-year-old boy who is looking for his forever home.

Hermes has lived in a home for years, and is a pro with stairs, other animals, walking well on leash, and he loves riding in the car and playing with his toys. He's a quiet and polite boy who stole the hearts of his foster parents within hours, will you let him steal yours too?

Hermes was returned due to a change in his former family that led to them being unable to keep him. He is a wonderful dog who will fit in just about any home. He is currently being fostered with two other greyhounds, a small dog, and a cat.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $200. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
