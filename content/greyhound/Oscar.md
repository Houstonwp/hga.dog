Oscar Riddle is a beautiful brindle male who turned 4 years old last October.  He was a bit shy and unsure coming off the track but his personality has really started to blossom as he has adjusted to a new home
life.  He is feeling much more certain of himself and his playful side has started to show.  He occasionally likes to gather items to take to his bed (his favorite is the small bathroom rug) but he is not destructive and just likes to have them handy.  He is a calm boy, a good walker, goes up and down stairs beautifully, does well living with a cat and happily accepts affection from a 9-year-old child. He is very happy to see the people he is familiar with and is always ready to wag his tail when spoken to or played with.  He needs a little practice getting into and out of a car, but does well once in the car.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Oscar at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
