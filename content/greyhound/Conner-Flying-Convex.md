Here's Flying Convex - aka Conner!  He's a 4 year old boy who has adjusted well and quickly to the foster home he shares with 3 other greyhounds.  He kennels well and has had no problems with house training.  He is happy, fun and playful, loves all kinds of toys and looking at himself in the mirror.  He's very curious and wants to investigate everything.  He does well on leash and is learning to take turns in the pack (he'd always like to be the first one out the door!).  Conner gives good hugs and is always up for a good belly rub. Conner is living with a foster family in the Omaha area.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Conner at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
