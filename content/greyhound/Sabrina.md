Here is Sabrina - She is as sweet as she is soft.  Sabrina is a small girl who loves to be with her foster family. She loves to cuddle her head into your arm.  Sabrina is 3 1/2 and is starting to gain weight after coming off the track.   WAGS would be a better name for her.  She wags her tail whenever anyone comes toward her.   Even when she is too dog-tired to get up, her tail still greets you.  
She heels on the leash without any prompting, and never pulls.  Sabrina is wonderful with small children and is small animal correctable.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Sabrina at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
