Calvin, aka Barts Rollwithme at the track, is a very pretty red boy. He is 5 years old and looking for a home full of love.  He is a very calm fellow who is cat and small dog friendly.  He enjoys quiet time in his crate as well as play time outside.  Calvin would be the perfect companion dog for an individual or the ideal addition for a family.  He has a sweet personality that you will be instantly drawn too.  Once you meet Calvin, you will want him to be part of your family. Calvin has already been living in a home for a while, so he has already learned the ropes of retired life. He was returned to us when his owner began having health problems and could no longer take care of him.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Calvin at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
