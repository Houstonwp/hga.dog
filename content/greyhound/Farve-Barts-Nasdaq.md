Farve aka Bart's Nasdaq, is a 3 year old black male fresh off the track. He is getting on well with the 3 other greyhounds but a little too interested in the cat. He may be cat correctable. He is doing stairs although still a bit shaky. He recently discovered toys. Although he doesn't destroy them he does like to give them a real good shaking. His favorite toy is a football. Give it to him and he will run around with it in his mouth until he finds a good place to chew on it. Farve is staying with a foster family in the Omaha area.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Farve at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
