Jagger (JJ Jagged Dart) is a sweet boy who will turn seven on June 24th. He's was in a home for a couple years, and is a very good boy. 

He's a sweet, mellow, affectionate boy who loves being the center of attention, and is really good on leash. He likes attention, but would rather not be in a home with very small children. He likes being around other dogs. He tested well with cats when he first retired, a re-check will be needed. 

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $225. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
