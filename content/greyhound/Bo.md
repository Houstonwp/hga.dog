Bo is a beautiful white and brindle boy who will be 4 years old in January.  Bo is living with an older I.G. and a cat and has been very well behaved.  He is also living with a six-year-old child and has been very gentle and accepting of her attention.  He is quickly learning stairs!



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Bo at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
