Here is Sampson - his racing name was Tyville Scorch, date of birth 5-27-2007.  Sampson is a beautiful fawn male!  He does well with small animals.  He is learing the retired life and is in the Omaha area. Sampson kennels well, and is quiet while in the kennel.  Sampson just came off the track on the 10th of July, so he and his foster family are learning something new everyday about each other!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Sampson at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
