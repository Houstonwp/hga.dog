Meet  Chc Evil Trent, or just plain Trent as we call him.
Don't let the racing name fool you, Trent is a very beautiful black greyhound.  He has lots of energy, and is living with other greyhounds and cats.  He will be 4 years old in November.

Trent has just broken a back leg, so it may be awhile  before he can go home with a family.   We will know more after he gets his cast and has a chance to heal up a little bit, so check back for more information on Trent.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Trent at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
