Farmboy is a very nice 6 yr-old boy. He is mostly white with a large brindle spot on one side and a little brindle around his ears. He is a double retiree!  He first retired from the track due to a fractured hock, and just recently retired from Southfield Wellness facility in Webster City. Farmboy worked there as a companion animal to the residents. He is ready to lay back and relax. He is very sweet and good with both small dogs and cats. He is a bit shy initially, but warms up quickly to sweet talking and affection. Please consider him as an addition to your family. 



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Farmboy at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
