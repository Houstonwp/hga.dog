Rhodey is a 4 year old red fawn boy, that has recovered from a broken hock. He is not good with small dogs or cats, but he is a lover. He has the confidence to be an only dog. Due to his hock injury he needs to be slowly re-introduced to running full speed.

This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
