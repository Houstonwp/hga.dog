Meet Barts Everclever, better known as Eagle.  Eagle is a small male who is developing quite a personality off of the track.  He is kind of destructive with his toys right now, but seems to be fine with small animals.  He seems to not know his own strength.  He is fine in the kennel, and is doing stairs well.  He is a playful and carefree greyhound.  Eagle will be just two in February.



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Eagle at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
