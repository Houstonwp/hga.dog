A Star Mercedes is a beautiful tiny brindle female.  She was born in March of 2007.  She is doing well with cats and small dogs, is working on mastering stairs and is beginning to settle into life off the track.  She kennels well and seems to be happy with what ever you ask of her.  Mercedes never really raced because she kept running over to people in the crowd to be admired!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Mercedes at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
