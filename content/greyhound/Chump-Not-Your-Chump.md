Chump (Not Your Chump), or Chumpzilla is a loving, and playful 4-year-old boy who loves to be outside and play with stuffed toys.  He is laid back, but loves to play when the toys beckon him. He will will even retrieve a ball or toy, but his favorite thing is to dance outside with his toys. (See the video!)

Chump is very smart.  In a very short time he has learned "come" and "stay".

Chump has not even attempted to get on furniture, but would love to if you invite him.  He walks well on his leash and enjoys sleeping in his dog bed.  He will gently greet you in the morning when you wake up, and ask for a few ear or belly rubs before you get ready to start you day.  Chump also likes to snuggle and you never have to tell him to eat his vegetables.  Two of his favorites are cucumbers and carrots!  

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
