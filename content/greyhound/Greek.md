Greek, known at the track as WW Gale Greek, is 3 1/2 years old. Photos rarely do justice to the beauty of a brindle greyhound. Greek is gorgeous. He's is great with small dogs. He lived with two without incident. Greek is crate trained and doing excellent with house training. He is a bit noisy in his crate and probably wouldn't be a good candidate for an apartment. Greek does well with other dogs and would be best in a home with other dogs. He does really well on a leash, no pulling. I can't stress enough how soft his coat is! Come to a meet & greet and see for yourself. 


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Greek at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
