My name is T Rex T Bone and I just came off the race track in Council Bluffs. The family Iâm staying with is having a little trouble deciding what to call me, so sometimes itâs Mr. T and other times, itâs just T. I donât care â Iâll answer to either one! 

Iâm 4 years old and Iâm a quiet, friendly guy. People tell me that I have a beautiful red brindle coat. I live with another Greyhound and an energetic Jack Russell terrier while Iâm awaiting adoption and I also have fun playing with children in my neighborhood. Iâm still coming out of my shell a bit after my years as a racer, but people tell me Iâm doing really well with the adjustment to life in retirement. I would love to meet you, so please ask about me!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Mr. T at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
