This is Sugar.  Sugar is about 8 months old and was found as a stray. She is a mix that we originally thought included greyhound, but now her size indicates she may be part whippet instead of greyhound - she may not end up weighing more than about 40 pounds or so.   Anyway, she is a very sweet puppy and already knows how to sit!  She was named Sugar because she likes to give lots of kisses! She has lived with kids ages 2 years and up, and other dogs, and has gotten along great with everybody. Sugar has been kenneled at night and during the day if her family is gone with no accidents.  She is still young and working on general puppy manners, but she is a smart dog and seems to figure things out fast. Please contact us to meet Sugar! 


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Sugar at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
