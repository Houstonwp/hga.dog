Slinky will be joining us this weekend (6/30/07) and at 10 years old she is ready for retirement!  She is happy and friendly and does not act her age.   Come meet her - these older girls are really something special!



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Slinky at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
