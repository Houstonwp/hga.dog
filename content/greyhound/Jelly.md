Jelly is just a puppy at 4 months old, so everything is a little new and scary for him but he is learning! He is a little interested in the foster family's cat, but they think the cat is teaching him some manners. Jelly is learning about bare floors, stairs, kennel and house training, and baths. Jelly is staying with a foster family in the Omaha area.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Jelly at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
