Meet Flag, known at the track as Green Flag Run.  He is a charming 4 year old male who had a distinguished racing career.  It is time for him to hang up his running paws in favor of a loving home.  Flag is shy at first but warms up very quickly.  He is living with a small dog, cats and another greyhound.  He kennels well, runs stairs with no problem, and enjoys playing in the yard.  His calm personality will make him the perfect grey for a young family or a great companion for a single adult. Don't wait; he'll be adopted quickly

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
