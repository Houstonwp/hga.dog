Dinky, or Dinky Dynamo as she was known on the track, is a sweet, petite, four year-old female.  Dinky originally came to her foster home quite shy, but her personality has really blossomed as she has adjusted to retirement.  Dinky is easy to have around and loves a soft bed and soft squeaker toys, which she likes to carry around with her.  Dinky likes to be with people and gives kisses when she is excited.  She is also an excellent walker on a leash and good car traveler.  Dinky is doing well living with three other greyhounds.  Dinky would do best in a home without small animals  


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Dinky at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
