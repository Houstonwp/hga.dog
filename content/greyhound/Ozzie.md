Boc's Ozzie is fresh off the track and ready for adoption!  Ozzie is about 2 1/2 years old.  He is a dark brindle with a white chest.  Ozzie is laid back and is very loving.  He likes the kennel and is good with small animals, and other dogs.  He does steps well and likes to run in the back yard.




  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Ozzie at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
