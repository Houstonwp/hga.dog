If you are looking for a total sweetheart this girl is for you. She is so easy going and already knows steps and is completely fitting into family life. "Nuttin" (name is still a little up in the air) lives with 2 other greyhounds, 2 yorkies and another foster greyhound and is just wonderful. This young girl loves to play with toys but also loves a comfy bed to relax in.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
