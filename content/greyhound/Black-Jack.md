My name is Black Jack and I'm a happy, outgoing guy. I have a shiny black coat with a white tuxedo marking on my chest and white toes on all my feet. I'm 4 years old and I just retired from the racetrack, where I went by the racing name Jack Jack Par. I love to be around people and to be petted. I especially like the 12-year-old boy at my foster home. Heâs the one who decided that I should start going by Black Jack. I also live with another Greyhound and Jack Russell terrier and I get along well with them both. I'd love to meet you, so please ask about me!

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
