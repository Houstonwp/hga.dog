Say hello to Shadow. He is 3 Â½ years old. He loves to play and loves his squeaky toys best. Shadow is very handsome â his shiny black coat glistens in the sun. He listens well and is eager to please; is very quiet and is getting the house training thing down well. He does extremely well on steps and slick floors to boot. He loves to watch the squirrels out in the yard playing from the wndow but if outside will chase them out of the yard fence. He likes our mules and horses in the neighborhood and likes his walks. Crate trained and quiet in his crate. Shadow is not cat safe and sometimes would like to be in charge. He may do best as an only pet, and/or with an experienced dog owner.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
