Meet Ferrari, also known as Rory.  He is 3 years old and just recently retired from the track.  Ferrari is settling into his foster home with 3 other big dogs and is getting along well with them.  He is not cat safe.  Ferrari loves his big bed, does well with his kennel and is housebroken.  He gets excited when his people come home and just wants some love!
If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Ferrari at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
