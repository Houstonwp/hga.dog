Villin (TH Chillinvillin) is about 4 1/2 yrs old.  He's a big boy and he seems to be a little cautious about new things at first.   He is OK with cats.  Villin would love to meet you, he's a real sweetie!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Villin at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
