Meet Benny, or âGood Enoughâ in his racing days.  Benny is only 3 years old, he retired early due to a leg muscle injury.  But that does not keep him from having fun in the yard and enjoying nice walks.  Benny is living with three other greyhounds, a miniature schnauzer and our one year old daughter.  Benny is a very good boy, he kennels well and sleeps right through the night.  Benny does steps and hardwood floors just fine.  Benny is a ready made fit into your family.  He has an outgoing but polite personality and would do fine as an only dog.  Please consider making Benny a part of your family!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Benny at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
