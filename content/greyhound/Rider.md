Here is UB Knight Rider better known as Rider born 10-22-06.
Â 





This beautiful black four year old is loving life after the track!Â  He is good with small dogs, the foster familyâsÂ  three year old daughter, kennels well and is good with stairs.Â He has been staying out of his kennel, but you will usually find him back in his kennel with the door open.Â  It is as if he has been in a home before, as comfortable as he is in a home setting.Â  Rider travels well in the vehicle and seems to not know a stranger.Â  He is currently living in Omaha , NE and would love to meet you!

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
