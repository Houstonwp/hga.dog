What about Bob?  Bob is 3 1/2 years old.  He  is a good boy who like lots of attention.  Bob is good on leash, good with stairs, and is learning the secret of getting around on hardwood floors.   He's also good with kids and would be a great addition to your family!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Bob at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
