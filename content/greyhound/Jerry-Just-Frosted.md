Say hello to Jerry, aka Just Frosted at the track. He will be 3 years old in August 2014. Jerry is a beautiful brindle greyhound and the perfect fit for any home. He is quiet, well tempered and gets along well with other dogs and young kids. He is a gentle giant! Jerry walks well on a leash and has a cute personality that will capture your heart quickly.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Jerry at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
