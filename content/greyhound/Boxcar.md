Boxcar is a sweet three year old boy. He is very smart. He knows the cat is in charge and is best left alone. He barks when he needs to go outside. The rattle of the leash equals fun. He also knows that is dog bed is more comfortable when it is shared with a layer of stuffed animals. He is a happy go lucky guy who does bark.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Boxcar at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
