Allie (Allie Blink) is a 2 year old, well mannered female who is a delight to be around. This lovely young lady is enjoying her retirement! She likes to run around like a maniac out in the yard, but is as lazy as they come in the house! Her shiny black coat is silky and soft. Allie is doing well living with cats and smaller dogs (whippets), however she would prefer a home without small children. Allie cruises up and down stairs without any problems, walks nicely on a leash, and enjoys car rides. She is quiet and relaxed in her crate, and of course, a champion napper!

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
