This is Jazz, aka Hibest Mindy. She is a beautiful dark brindle and  6 yrs. old. Jazz had a good career racing, and spent a year raising puppies. Now she is ready for a life of leisure. Jazz has been in foster care for over a year. She does well with other medium to large dogs. She is ready to be in her forever home. She is house trained and crate trained. Don't let her age fool you, she is full of personality. She would be a good jogging companion. Jazz is not safe with cats or small dogs. She is quite sociable with a very happy wagging tail, and gives plenty of kisses. Jazz loves to play fetch!   She has been busy learning new things in her retirement and now knows how to give a paw and shake.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
