Gurgle is a cute stocky little boy who won't be two until April of 2017.  He gets along well with multiple greyhounds he is with.  He lays right down in the living room and loves to fit into the family and hang out with his people.  He does stairs like a champ and is a patient boy.  His black coat and face are beautiful and his foster mom says he loves to steal slippers and carry them around! Gurgle is learning about toys and life in a home and showing more of his personality every day! 

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
