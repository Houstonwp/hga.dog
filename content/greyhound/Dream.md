Meet Dream - her racing name was Only in Dreams and she is 6 years old. She has a beautiful dark brindle coat - the pictures don't do it justice! She's a small, quiet girl who is behaving perfectly in foster care. She walks very nicely on leash. Dream loves to pick a squeaky toy and carry it around everywhere - it is very cute! If you are looking for an easy-going greyhound who loves life off the track, this is the girl for you. Dream had a second career raising puppies, so she is definitely ready for retirement! She is doing well in a home where she is the only pet, but she does enjoy the company of other dogs.  She is not cat safe.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Dream at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
