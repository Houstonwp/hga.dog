Lewis Walker is a big, white 3 1/2 year old male. Lewis is a greyhound that LOVES to be talked to, and gets very excited when you talk to him. He is a big tail wagger and seems to be a joy to be around. Lewis has a robust personality and seems to be a quick learner. He is good with a small dog and will be kitty correctable.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
