Athena is a greyhound mix (Staghound) who is estimated to be around 6 years old. She was picked up as a stray with no ID, attempts were made to find her owners, but were unsuccessful.

This sweet lady is about 60lbs. She is quiet and enjoys being close to her people. Athena is not demanding about attention, but she will gaze into your eyes and sit forever as she gets her chest rubbed. 

Although she likes to chew on bones, her favorite toy activity involves finding all toys in the area and collecting them into a pile! She shares well with others and likes to cuddle up with Venus or her humans. She is adorable when excited and is prone to giving gentle hugs or zooming in the yard when revved up. She walks well on a leash and doesnât make a peep in her kennel.

Athena is very smart: she picks up on new commands effortlessly and has a âgo with the flowâ mentality about life. She would fit into any routine with ease!

** Athena may be mother to Venus who was picked up at the same time, and the two show an obvious bond**

If you would like to meet this dog, please e-mail HGA at HeartlandGreyhound@outlook.com or call 515-967-6564 (please leave a message) and we will get back to you as soon as possible with more information. The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
