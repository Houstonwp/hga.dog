Introducing "Moose" aka Beatm All. He had a very long and successful racing career and will be turning 5 in May. He was renamed by his foster family because of his enormous size, coming in at a muscular 90 lbs! But don't be intimidated because he has turned into their gentle giant. He loves to play with his owner and stick right by their side running and jumping. He is truely a happy-go-lucky dog without a care in the world. He has adjusted to the home life with zero issues and is ready for the retired life. Moose is not an alpha male nor is he submissive, just a very neutral dog, and because of this Moose would do great in almost any situation; family's with children or other dogs are welcome to apply for this wonderful boy.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
