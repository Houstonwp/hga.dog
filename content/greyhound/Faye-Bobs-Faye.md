Introducing Faye (Bob's Faye) a sweet and shy brood mama.

Faye is a quiet girl who shows her affection by shadowing her people around the house and giving tail wags to show she is pleased to see you. She would prefer a quiet home that is peaceful and relaxing, but with a few toys she can play with from time to time.

Faye has settled into her foster home quickly, she does stairs and has had no accidents at all. 

If you would like to meet this dog, please e-mail HGA at jodye83@gmail.com or call 515-967-6564 (please leave a message) and we will get back to you as soon as possible with more information. The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $200. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
