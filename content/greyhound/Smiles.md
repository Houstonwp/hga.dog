Here is BNS Wax n Smile, aka Smile or Smiles. Smiles just turned two on 8/17/11.  What a smiler she is!!  She smiles all the time, and it is so cute!  She is a pretty brindle girl who tested good with a small dog.   We just got her on 10/2/11, so we are still learning about her, but she kenneled fine and is quiet in the kennel.  She is learning the stairs and will catch on fast. She seems like a sweet happy smiling girl!


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Smiles at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
