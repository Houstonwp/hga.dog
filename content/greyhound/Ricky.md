Hereâs Ricky! A beautiful four year old fawn, Ricky raced under the name Gnarls Barkley. He retired in late November and has been adjusting well to life off the track. Ricky has had no accidents in the house and is working on getting down the stairs (which he climbs up with ease). Youâll never have to guess how Rickyâs feeling because he has an expressive âhelicopter tail.â It really gets going when heâs excited! Ricky enjoys running in the backyard and loves chasing the ball, though he hasnât figured out what to do with it once he catches it. Currently being fostered in Omaha with another greyhound, Ricky has not been tested with cats but has done fine around small dogs. Ricky is a pretty calm boy, but give him a little attention and you just might get him to bow and smile!

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
