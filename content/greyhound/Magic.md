Magic is a 7 year old male currently living with 2 other greyhounds and 2 cats.  His foster mom says he is a very affectionate boy who loves to be close to you.  If he needs some attention he will bump your hand to let you know he needs a little love.  Magic walks well on leash and loves his walks.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Magic at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
