Jim Dandy (Bocâs Jim Dandy) is a playful young boy who will turn two in December. He's a very sweet boy who prances when going on walks, which is a sure attention getter.

Jim Dandy has been learning all about toys. He loves rubber toys that he can chew on, he loves to chew on a bone or bully stick for days. He's been a good boy only chewing on his things and not his humansâ things.

He follows his foster family around everywhere. He knows his full name, and the word no. He doesn't beg for food and lets us know when he's gotta go potty.

Jim Dandy loves to cuddle. While he's full of energy he loves to nap, sun bathe, and be lazy too. 


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
