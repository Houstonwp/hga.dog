'Tyville Wood "Woody" is a sweet gentlemanly 4 year old. He is content just to be with his family. He is a huge snuggle-bug. He loves playing with toys and chewing on nylabones. He gets along with dogs of all sizes and is cat safe. He has earned 'house privileges' and can be trusted out of a crate during the day. He does not chew inappropriately or bark. He walks very nicely on leash and does not pull. Woody would do just fine as an only dog or with canine siblings, but would do best in a home without small children. He would be an excellent apartment dog. '
 

  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Woody at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
