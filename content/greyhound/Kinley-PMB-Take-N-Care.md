Sweet, sweet, sweet is what this petite little 7.5 year old girl is.  Kinley, who raced under the name "PMB Take N Care" was a mama dog who has quickly become a favorite of her foster parents.  Kinley has a beautiful and soft dark brindle coat.  She loves to have her chin and face rubbed and to be talked to.  She gets along very well with other dogs.  Kinley is extremely smart and learned her name in a day and other words in just a matter of a couple days.  She has an adorable way of sleeping
with her mouth agape and her tongue hanging out of the side.  Kinley has a slight limp due to a hock that was broken at some point, but gets around well.  She can take short walks, but is likely not a good match for someone who is looking for a companion for long walks or jogs. 

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Kinley at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $175. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
