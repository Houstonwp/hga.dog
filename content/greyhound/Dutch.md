Dutch is a loving 5 year old greyhound.  He is completely house trained and is very comfortable in the home.  He is living with a small dog.  He loves being petted, is very mellow,  and is not a velcro dog at all.  He is happy just being in the same room with you.  He gets along well with other dogs in the home, kennels well when asked and loves all the excitement a home brings.    He is a beautiful brindle male.  Come and see Dutch at a meet and greet near you!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Dutch at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
