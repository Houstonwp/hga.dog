Here's Nolan!   His racing name was Aint No Quitter.  Nolan is a beautiful brindle male who will be 4 in December (12-07-04).  Nolan has a very sweet disposition and is very loving.  He does great being
around an elderly cat and small dog.  He likes to hang around the family, seems to be very good with children and is adjusting well to his foster home, hardwood floors and stairs.  His personality is starting to come out and he is showing a more playful side but is calm and well behaved too.  A great placement for a family looking for a second dog as he is much happier with a companion.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Nolan at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
