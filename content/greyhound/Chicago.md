RJ's Chicago is 4 years old and just off the track (on 2/8/08).  He is very striking and is doing well in his foster home with 3 other greyhounds.  He has already learned to do stairs!  Chicago is not good with cats and other small animals, but he is good with kids and he loves to snuggle!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Chicago at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
