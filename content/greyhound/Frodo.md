Frodo is a seventy pound, six year old male who had a full racing career and is now looking for a forever home in which to enjoy his retirement.  Frodo is an extremely mellow boy who is very easy to have around and take places.  He does well with other dogs and is currently living with three other greys.  He has also done well with small dogs.  Frodo is an excellent walker on a leash and a great car passenger.  He is very attentive and a quick learner.  He is affectionate and loves head and ear rubs and just being with people.  He also does well with kids.  Frodo is a confident boy, but not an alpha dog and would be a great addition to any home.  


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Frodo at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
