Tokyo Rose is a 3 year old sweetheart. She is wonderful with kids and has shown us that she would truly love the company of another dog in her forever home. She really perked up when we brought another greyhound into our house for the weekend! She kennels well, sleeps all night and loves to go for walks. She is a smaller grey with a petite frame. She has never had an accident in the house. She goes up and down wood stairs very well. She is very affectionate and will lay her head in your lap. She loves to curl up on her bed. Tokyo will make a great addition to any greyhound-loving home.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
