Silver Ray is a 3 yr-old black male.  He is living with other greyhounds and cats.  Ray is very striking and handsome with his white feet and chest.  He would love to be part of your family!   



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Ray at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
