Rhythm (VJ Iam In Rhythm) is a happy, confident, and loving fellow. He's 70lbs and will turn 4 in November.

Rhythm is full of happiness, enthusiasm, and life; but he's not hyper. This boy is an explorer who loves his walks and seeing new things. He loves people, other animals, and toys. He's living with another greyhound and an Italian greyhound, he did well on his cat test.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
