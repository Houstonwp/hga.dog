Introducing Emma (B's Emma) a lovely two-year-old who is a bit shy, but very curious about the world around her. She's opening up a bit more every day as she settles in at her foster home. She did well at her first meet and greet, seeing and being pet by a lot of people. 

She's a smart gal who is learning "sit" and "come", she's sensitive to correction so positive reward based training is a must with her. She's good about letting you know if she needs to be let outside.

She loves walks, and playing chase the ball in the yard. She also loves her crate, and will want one available as her quiet space. She is a thief who will hoard items in her crate; she loves blankets.

Emma does stairs without a problem, she's been exposed to small animals with little reaction. She did bark at a cat when he was moving and she wasn't quite sure what he was, but gave him space when he growled at her. She wanted to chase when the cat ran, but took correction instantly. She will probably be good with cats, but care will be needed during introductions.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
