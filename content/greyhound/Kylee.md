Meet Kylee  this sweet girl is four years old. 

Kylee is great on a leash and loves her walks, but romping in the yard is one of her favorite things to do. Napping and getting petted are other favorites. She likes her people, and is always happy to greet visitors.

Kylee is good with other dogs large and small, and with cats. 

She's quiet in the house (outdoors too, unless she's grunting at a squirrel), and really likes her crate. She is not confident on slick floors, so will need a home with lots of carpet. 


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
