Gabby (Tear Drop) is a cute brindle who will be 3 in December.  She is fresh off the track and still establishing her personality in a home, but seems to be spunky and is currently living with two other greyhounds and a cat.  She does stairs well and is full of personality.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Gabby at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
