Clinger is a sweet, seventy pound, five year old male.  Clinger has been enjoying his retirement and has a special fondness for all soft squeaker type toys.  He is great at playing fetch and will bring a toy right back to you.  He is doing very well living with three other greyhounds and has also done well with small children.  Clinger is a good car passenger and is learning to walk without pulling on a leash.  Clinger is a great cuddler and loves to be with people.  He is also house trained and is unkenneled when his foster family is going during the day and has had no accidents.  

  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Clinger at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
