Ally and Busy are two 8 yr-old mama dogs who have been together a long time and would love to go to the same home. Ally is a pretty fawn girl, very sweet. She has no trouble with slick floors or steps, and will potty on leash. Ally, like Busy, showed very little interest in a cat. These girls are both total sweethearts - you have to meet them!


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Ally at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $175. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
