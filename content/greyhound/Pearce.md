Delray Pearce is a pretty black female who is 2 years old.  She is not cat safe although she is getting along well with a small dog at her foster home.  Pearce's foster mom says she is a total sweetheart with tons of personality and a beautiful coat.  She is already housebroken and sleeps through the night next to the bed.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Pearce at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
