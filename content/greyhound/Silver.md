This is Silver, aka A Star Silver, date of birth 3-12-2006.  Silver is a calm and loving greyhound!  He is a beautiful white and brindle boy.  Silver has been doing well with small animals, gets along well with other dogs, and is quickly learning about stairs and wood flooring.  Silver is having some issues with hot spots and his coat is looking kind of rough so he wonât be attending meet & greets right now.  He will stay in his foster home until he has healed up but will be ready to go to his forever home this fall.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet a certain dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure that dog is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
