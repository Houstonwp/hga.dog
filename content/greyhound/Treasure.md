Treasure is a beautiful fawn female!  Her date of birth is 11-25-07.  She will be two in November.  Treasure has tested okay with small dogs and a kitty.  She just came in off the track (late October), and seem to fit right in with her foster family and their two other greyhounds.  Treasure loves playing with squeaky toys!



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Treasure at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
