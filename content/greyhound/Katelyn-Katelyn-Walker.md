Kate is a very sweet, full of energy, 2-year-old puppy. She loves to go on walks but is a little shy of quick movements. She plays hard outside with toys and loves to race the fence line to see what is in every part of the yard. She likes to bark at the neighbor horses when they play in the pasture so I am not sure she would be good around livestock. She is also a little too interested in cats. She seems to get along just fine with our big dogs and loves squeaky toys and to play fetch. She does well with steps and slick floors.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
