Pele is a brindled boy who will turn 4 in June, named after the Brazilian soccer star.  He is small animal safe. He likes to play with stuffed animals, loves people, and likes to wake up at 5 am. He currently resides in the Omaha area with two resident greys, a foster and the Omaha test cat Nigel.

This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
