Highlight Thelma is a stunningly beautiful little 6 yr old girl who has been living in a home for a few years - she was returned to us through no fault of her own. She is white with faint freckles, 'eyeliner' and the cutest little Mohawk down her neck. Thelma is a laid back, gentle girl and gets along with all the other dogs she has met. She walks very nicely on leash, and really likes riding in the car.  She is very smart and has already learned all about retired life.   Thelma may do best in a home where she has another dog for company, or where her people are around much of the day.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Thelma at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
