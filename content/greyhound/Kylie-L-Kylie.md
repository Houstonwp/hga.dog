Meet Kylie (L Kylie). He may not have been a grand champion on the racetrack, but this sweet 3-year-old boy sure has been in foster care. From day one, Kylie has been very quiet, he may whine softly a bit when kenneled, but settles quickly. Heâs a little shy at first, but warms up quickly to new people. 

He has had no accidents in the house, and never even attempted to mark before he was neutered. Kylie does well on stairs and slick floors. Heâs good with children, but they need to respect his need for space when heâs resting. He tested OK with cats, he was pretty excitable, but fairly easy to distract. 

Kylie took to toys early on and has come to LOVE his Honky Pigs! If he goes to another room, he is sure to bring one with him. He is very playful with his toys, but not destructive. He likes to shake them and gently toss them in the air.

He loves being outside, and has enjoyed romping in the snow despite the cold. He loves his daily walk, and doesnât pull on his leash.

Kylie has had a bit of a rough beginning to his retirement. At his neuter it was discovered that one of his testicles was inside his body, and surrounded by a tumor. The mass was removed, he was given an X-ray, and a blood test to check for anything more. Both the X-ray and blood test came back clean. While the vet is unable to give us any guarantee of no further trouble, she did say itâs unlikely.  Since the tumor was removed, unless it had already spread (which the X-ray and blood test indicate it probably had not), his likelihood of developing any more tumors is very little higher than in any other dog.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
