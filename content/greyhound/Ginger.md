Ginger is an adorable girl who is just turning 2 years old.  She gets along will with all the other dogs in her foster home, does not seem to be a problem with the kitties, and she will need to have her cast off in a week or so.  Ginger suffered a crack, not a clear break, and once healed she will be as good as new!  She is doing well with house training.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Ginger at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
