Johnny loves to play with his squeaky toys and is wonderful on a walk. Unlike most retired greyhounds, we are not sure exactly how old he is but we think he is about 18 months old.  He is currently living with small children and doing well.  Johnny can be a little shy to start, but is very affectionate once he relaxes. He wants nothing more than to be by your side and be petted.  He sleeps peacefully in his kennel at night, he has learned to climb and descend stairs. He is ok with all floor surfaces, wood, tile, carpet. He bathes easily outdoors, and is a great leash-walker. Johnny is not cat safe!

If you would like to meet this dog, please e-mail HGA at jodye83@gmail.com or call 515-967-6564 (please leave a message) and we will get back to you as soon as possible with more information.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
