Cheese is a very energetic boy (for a greyhound)  He would do wonderful with someone who is looking for a slightly more active dog.  He is treat motivated and his foster family has started working with him on some basic commands.  He loves to snuggle and will follow you around the house in hopes of being petted.  He can be a pretty dominant dog so he should either be an only dog or live with dogs that do not have a alpha personality. He is currently living with three greyhounds and two cats.  But he is definitely the top  dog!  Due to his energy level we think he would do best in a home without small children at this time, although as he gets older he will probably calm down a bit.  Cheese also loves taking walks and is very well behaved on a leash.  Cheese is currently in Cedar Rapids.

If you would like to meet this dog, please e-mail HGA at jodye83@gmail.com or call 515-967-6564 (please leave a message) and we will get back to you as soon as possible with more information.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
