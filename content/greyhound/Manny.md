Here is Manny, known at the track as Messenger Man. Manny is almost 3 years old â his birthday is July 24, 2009. Manny has a beautiful black shiny coat.  He tested okay with the initial small animal testing and is living with a greyhound in Ankeny. More information to followâ¦..


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Manny at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
