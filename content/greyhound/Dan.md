Here is Dan - what a stunning Greyhound he is!  He has a beautiful coat that is white with brindle spots here and there. His foster family says he is such a sweetie - he's really a gentle soul. Loves rides in the car, anyone and everyone who takes the time to pet him, napping, and running in the yard. Gets along well with other dogs (and cats). Very people oriented. Will do anything for a neck or ear rub...  Dan has been living in a home previously and was returned through no fault of his own, so he already knows the ropes of retired life!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Dan at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
