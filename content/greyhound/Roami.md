Roami got loose in Southeastern Nebraska. While she was lost she was shot in her shoulder and turned up at a veterinarian's office at least 30 miles from home after being loose a week. Unable to pay for her care her owner signed her over to the clinic. HGA was alerted to her situation, and once we stepped up to offer her a place the vet was able to decide to continue life-saving treatment over putting her to sleep.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
