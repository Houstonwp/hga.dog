Introducing Kristoff, a sweet and charming 2-year-old greyhound mix boy.

Kristoff loves to cuddle and give hugs. He also gives sloppy open-mouth kisses if you let him. When he's excited he air snaps with his teeth, but he's not trying to make contact.

He has tested well with small dogs and a cat, but he will need to meet any smaller family residents before placement to see how he reacts to them individually.

Kristoff likes children, but can be mouthy when he plays.

Kris would be a good option for someone looking for a jogging partner. He's young and enthusiastic, and would enjoy the exercise. He's not hyper though, so would be fine with normal walks and running in the yard if there isn't a jogger in the family.


Winter weather updates for meet & greets and other events: In case of inclement winter weather, check the Heartland Greyhound Adoption Facebook page for last-minute updates. Or follow us on Facebook and have those updates delivered to your newsfeed!
If you would like to meet this dog, please e-mail HGA at HeartlandGreyhound@outlook.com or call 515-967-6564 (please leave a message) and we will get back to you as soon as possible with more information. The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
