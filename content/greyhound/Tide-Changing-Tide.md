Tide (Changing Tide) is a sweet young boy who is settling into retirement nicely. He just had a birthday on December 7th and turned 2. He took to the elevator in his apartment building with ease.

Tide is friendly and playful. He's a smart boy who would probably be good at learning and doing some tricks, he's very food motivated. Tide does play fetch!

Tide walks very well on leash, and is quick about going potty. He's living in an apartment in Downtown Omaha. He's good with other dogs, and has tested well with cats.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
