Meet Robin. She's a dainty little three-year-old gal with a gorgeous face and mesmerizing eyes. She is a shy girl, but likes belly rubs once she gets to know you. 

Robin walks very nicely on leash, kennels well, and does stairs with no problems.

Robin is good with other dogs, and with cats. She's good with kids, but would prefer if they are under about 10 that they just be visitors, because she's sensitive to noise and a lot of activity.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
