Meet Superior Pandora! Pandora is a 6 years old. She currently is living with other large dogs and doing well. She is quiet, crate trained, and a quick learner. She isn't living with a cat, but passed her initial indoor cat test. This girl is very sweet, calm and loving. Her coat is stunning and soft. She will give you all day to stop petting her.

If you would like to meet this dog, please e-mail HGA at jodye83@gmail.com or call 515-967-6564 (please leave a message) and we will get back to you as soon as possible with more information.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
