Here is Bustin' Loose - he is 2 1/2 years old (will be 3 in August '12).  He is a big boy, who is very quiet and well behaved.  He is small animal safe and LOVES his kennel.  He would make a perfect apartment grey as he is very quiet in the kennel.  We will have more updates on him as we get to know him better.

Winter weather updates for meet & greets and other events: In case of inclement winter weather, check the Heartland Greyhound Adoption Facebook page for last-minute updates. Or follow us on Facebook and have those updates delivered to your newsfeed!

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
