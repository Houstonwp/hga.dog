GV Luke is an all black male who was born April 2009. He is very well behaved in the house and has never had any accidents, and we have yet to even hear him bark. He is very quiet and comes off as being shy intially. Once he warms up to you though he will stay by your side; that is until he decides he wants to take a nap! Luke would do just fine in a house where there already might be a "Princess" or "Prince" ruling the household or with a first time dog owner. He has no problem being the loyal subject as long as he has a soft bed to call his own. He is still trying to figure out the stairs and he hasn't quite mastered what seeing his own reflection means. But he is well adjusted to the kennel and will sleep through the night without a peep. So far his favorite activity is running alongside our other Greyhounds as they chase their favorite toys.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Luke at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
