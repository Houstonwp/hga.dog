Frank, WWâs Flame On, is a complete charmer who loves to be talked to. He hops up and down on his front legs and snaps his jaws when heâs excited, but most of the time heâs as quiet and mellow a dog as you could wish for. He likes to shake stuffed toys, but isnât fond of the squeakers. He enjoys ear and face rubs. He loves to go for walks, and has very good leash manners. 

Frank will be 4 on April 16th. Heâs currently being fostered in Omaha with two cats and another greyhound. Heâs getting along very well with the cats. Frank will play-chase if they run, so introductions to nervous cats should be carefully monitored.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Frank at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
