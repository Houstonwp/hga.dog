Meet Barts Hot Air, better known as Dice.  He will turn 2 in November. Dice is a young, beautiful, black and white male.  He is cat and small dog safe.  Dice just came off the track on in early August so he is just learning the retired lifestyle.  He is well behaved, kennels well and seems to like the social life that comes with an active family with other dogs.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Dice at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
