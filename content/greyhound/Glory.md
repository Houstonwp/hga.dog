Glory is not quite 2 years old and is already ready for retirement! She loves her toys and likes to carry them around, and loves to go for walks! She has lots of energy, but her foster family says she can also fall asleep standing up if sheâs got a lap to lean on! Glory has already learned how to do stairs and is really settling in to living in a home. So far she has been a little protective of her toys and âspaceâ around other dogs, but has been fine with the humans in the family.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
