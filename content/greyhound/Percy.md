Percy is a small 3 year old male who is being fostered in Cedar Rapids.He is light brown with a feathering black stripe that goes from his shoulders all the way down his tail.Percy enjoys people and other dogs and has past experience visiting care facilities.He prances around when excited and curls up like a little deer when tired.Percy enjoys car rides,walks and big soft blankets. He is not cat safe and is probably best with larger dogs.

Percy has tested positive for Lyme disease and erlichia, both tick-borne diseases. He is not sick, but he is a carrier and will need to be on tick preventatives and have yearly titers to check the levels in his blood. 

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Percy at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present. Beginning July 1, 2014, the adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
