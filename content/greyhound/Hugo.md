Meet Hugo!  Hugo turned four in December.  He is a fabulous boy who is loving life after the track!  He gets along great with small animals and he loves to play in the backyard when he is let outside.  He kennels well while you are away, and loves to lay around and watch what you are doing from a nice soft dog bed!  Hugo's beautiful coloring is that of a German Shorthair.  He is housetrained and sleeps through the night.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Hugo at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
