Meet Iggy (Iggy Pop Walker)

I am a young boy, not quite 2 yrs. old but I am ready to be a new member of your family.  My foster mom and dad say Iâm the quickest learner they have ever had.  I am housebroken, I can do stairs, I love to lay by your side and canât wait for my daily walks.  I start to get into mischief but I always get caught and know when to leave things alone.  I like my foster dog-sister very much and we run around the backyard and have lately played in the leaves.  Come and pet me in person at the next meet and greet.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
