Here's Boc's Skippy Lou, winner of the 2009 Iowa Breeder's Cup! She's turning 6 years old on 2/21/13 and she is ready for retirement! She seems very sweet so far. We're not sure if she's small animal safe, but has paid no attention to an Italian greyhound in her foster home. More info to come!

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
