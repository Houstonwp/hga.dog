Clapton is a striking fawn male with a robust personality, just about 4 years old.  He is a dream foster, as he loves his kennel, does stairs like a champ, is quiet, and loves his people.  He loves to grab a bed when his people are home, and snooze the day away.  He loves walks and running in the back yard and loves to chew on bones.  He settles quickly and is a very good listener.  He responds to no, and comes when you call him.  He does like Kitties a little too much, and we would not place him in a home with a cat, however he lives with a medium size dog and has been fine.  He would do great as an only dog too. This wonderful boy is ready for a home!

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
