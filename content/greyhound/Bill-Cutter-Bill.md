Bill is a 3 year old fawn boy who is living with another greyhound in a foster home in Newton. He has a little bit of trouble with a healed broken leg, but in general he gets around just fine. He's a very friendly boy who greets people with a smile that shows lots of teeth! Bill is learning to share and play with toys. He has had issues with being kenneled in another home, but is slowly getting used to it, especially if there is another dog around. Bill is a very lovable boy who seems to be good with children and cats. He's never met a stranger and will snuggle up to anybody for some lovin' - Bill's foster mom thinks he could be a good therapy dog because he is so loving, curious, and gentle. He is a sweetie with lot of confidence.

This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
