Annie is 7 years old, she will be 8 in December, 2011. She was found as a stray in Marshalltown. She is house trained, crate trained, very good on a leash and loves attention. She is not good with small dogs or cats. She does fine with medium size dogs and likes children. Don't let Annie's age and cool exterior fool you. She acts half her age and loves to play.  
 

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Annie at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for senior greyhounds (age 7 and older) through HGA is $175. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
