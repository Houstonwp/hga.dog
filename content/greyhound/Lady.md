Lady is an 8 year old dark brindle and white girl who was returned due to the health of her owners. She was born in April 2004. She is good with small dogs and cats. Lady is house trained and loves her crate. She is very affectionate and when she warms up, loves to play. She would be fine as an only dog. Lady is excellent on the leash, and would make a great walking companion. She is protective of her space. So, it would be best for her to be around older children.  


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Lady at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for senior greyhounds through HGA is $175. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
