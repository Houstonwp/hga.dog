Meet Yamaha! She is a very sweet 8 1/2 year old, beautiful female who does NOT act her age! She has been a PERFECT foster dog with no accidents in the house,  kennels well, and can wait quite a while before she needs to go out. She would be a good match for a working family/individual.  Yamaha is a perfect walker and gets really excited when the leash is picked up.  She is walking an average of 3 miles a day.  She also LOVES truck rides. Yamaha is not small-animal safe. She is being fostered in Altoona

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $200. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
