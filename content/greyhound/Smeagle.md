Here is DK's Smeagle - her date of birth is 10-15-2007.  Smeagle is a sweet, tiny, red fawn female.  She is adjusting to foster life. She never raced and was the smallest out of a litter of pups.  She was placed directly from the owner to a family in central Iowa.  They could no longer keep her and she had previously been kept outside and was allowed to run at large when out of the pen, but was living close to a very busy road and she did not realize how dangerous that was.  She is now beginning her life as an indoor greyhound and she is learning something new everyday.  She is currently living with with two greyhounds.



  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Smeagle at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
