Meet Rob!  He recently turned 5 and is a wonderful fawn boy with eyeliner eyes.  Rob had been living in a home for the past two years and due to unfortunate circumstances he needs to be re-homed.  Rob is fully housetrained, gets along great with our 3 year old daughter, our other hounds and min schnauzer.  Rob is a very happy boy, his tail is always going and he would be a perfect companion for your family.  If you are looking for your very first greyhound, look no further than Rob!  He also comes with three beds, raised feeding bowl and lots and lots of his favorite treats!  Rob's original foster family has sent us an e-mail vouching for his sweet personality and offering to babysit any time!  Rob is currently in foster care in Omaha, NE.



If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Rob at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
