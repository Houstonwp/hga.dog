Warran is about 4 years old and is a beautiful big boy. He walks very well on the leash, is great on steps and getting there on slippery floors. Warran has been  learning cue words such as relax and is such a lover. He is sometimes not the best at getting along with all dogs because he can be a bit of an alpha dog. He should be introduced to other pets carefully and watched at play and around the food bowl and toys. He is very smart and is a master at playing tricks on you. Warran is completely crate trained and learning house training really well, but still needs to be watched just a little. He is Mr. Personality Plus, with energy to spare for the active family on the go but also has a sensitive side that enjoys cuddle time.

This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
