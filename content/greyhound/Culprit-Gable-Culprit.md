Meet Culprit (Gable Culprit), a handsome fellow who just turned six in June. This boy can't get enough affection, and is a very happy and eager to please. Culprit, loves, loves, loves his walks.  When he's done with this walks he immediately wants to go out again.  Culprit walks well on a leash, heals, and sits on command.  Culprit is house trained, and has had no accidents in the house. He kennels well, but has been well behaved when not kenneled as well. He loads and travels well in the car.

Heâs a relaxed boy who loves to snooze upside-down on his bed, and will clown around by wallowing on his back in his bed (see video). 

 Culprit gets along well with the greyhounds at his foster home, and has nicely met smaller dogs on his walks. Outdoors he should be muzzle when turned out with other dogs; he plays rough. He is a gentleman during feeding time and isn't possessive of his dish.  Heâs been good around the older children he has met.  


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
