Our Batman may not spend his nights protecting the streets of Gotham, but he's sure to make your home a better place.

Batman is four-years-old, and as mellow and pleasant a greyhound as you could possibly ask for. He's doing very well on learning stairs, is extremely good on leash and loves his walks. He wants all the pets you will give him but isn't pushy about it. He's been such a wonderful foster that his foster mom's only "complaint" about him is that he fell asleep on her yoga mat.

Batman is good with kids, cats, and other dogs. 

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
