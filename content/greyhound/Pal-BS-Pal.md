Pal is a three and a half year old male (6/4/10) who is being fostered in Omaha.  He broke his leg racing. He had a cast for three weeks and a splint for two. The splint came off on October 17th. 

When I picked up Pal, his trainer described him as a happy dog. They did not tell me that he is a heart stealer. He is cat friendly. His tail is always wagging. He kennels easily and is a quiet dog. He charmed the entire clinic during his visits concerning the cast. He is a lover. My kids and I are going to miss him after he is adopted and will talk about him for along time to come.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Pal at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
