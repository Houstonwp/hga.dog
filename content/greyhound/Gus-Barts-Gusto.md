 Take a look at this winning smile. Bart's Gusto comes fresh from the track with a personality that is ready for your home. Known as Gus, this big boy is a 4 year old gentle giant. His beautiful autumn red color will have him blending with the fallen leaves this fall in your yard. Gus could care less about the cats that he lives with. He expresses his emotions through his tail with a happy wag as you enter the room or offer him some well deserved affection. He walks well on leash but loves a fenced yard to be able to explore. He is crate trained and has had no accidents in his foster home. Gus would be ideal for a family looking for pet to grow up with or a single person home looking for a companion. As you can see from his photo, his Groucho Marx style eyebrows tell the whole story of his great personality. Take the opportunity to meet Gus, he will warm your heart

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
