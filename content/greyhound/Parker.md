Here is Hilltex Parker.  His date of birth is 9-07-2006, so he will be 5 in September 2011.  He is a good looking red and white boy. Parker is kenneling well, and did steps the first day like he had always done them.  He tested okay with the kitty and a small dog.  He is learning about life off the track and seems like a quiet natured boy!  Parker is staying with a foster family in Sioux Falls.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Parker at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
