This is Carly â DOB 7/1/12 â 17 months old and 52 lbs.  She would not run the track.  Would run a little ways and then wanted to sniff and look around and wait for her friends to come around so they could play! J  She is itty bitty.  She is very, very sweet.  She is out of Just Gingerâanother sweetheart. She is doing great with house training. Due to her young age she will need a family that will crate her & be willing to work on obedience.   She would need a fenced yard as she has energy to burn and isnât used to being taken out on leash to potty. Carly needs time to warm up to other dogs. With time she will share her bed with the other greyhounds. She hasn't been tested with cats or small dogs.  Love this little pixie!!!!!

This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
