Phil is a gorgeous, shiny black boy who seems to have
a sweet personality. He loves to hug and snuggle!  His foster mom is calling him Phil Collins - she says he's as beautiful as a rockstar!  He walks well on a leash, and is getting along great with the three other greyhounds in his foster home.   Phil tested small animal correctable and is currently living with 3 greyhounds.  He will be 4 in January.  


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Phil at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
