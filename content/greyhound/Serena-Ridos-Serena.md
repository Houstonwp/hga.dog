This is Rido's Serena - A VERY beautiful brindle lady! She just turned 6 in July, however she thinks she is a two year old!! Look at those ears!! Serena is doing great on house training and her manners in the house. She is not good with small animals but she does fine with other greyhounds and big dogs.  She was the star at a children's event this spring - she did great with all the kids. Serena has lived with other dogs and as an only pet. She is currently staying in the Omaha area.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Serena at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
