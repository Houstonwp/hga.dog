Tungsten (DS Tungsten) is a happy three-year-old little gal with really soft fur.

Tungsten loves to play with and carry around toys, especially the squeaky ball. She is quiet in her crate, sleeps through the night, and has had zero accidents in the house. She's a sweet and responsive girl who will follow you around the house. She walks really nicely on leash, and doesn't pull a bit. She is getting more and more cuddly as the days go by.

 She's getting along wonderfully with two other greyhounds, and is doing very well with the cat. She would need some work to be OK with a small dog when outdoors.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
