This is L's B Wilson, or Wilson for short. He turned 2 in January '14 and seems to be a very good-tempered boy, putting up with his cast without complaint. He'll be seeing the vet soon for his broken leg. Wilson looks to be good with small animals - he had no interest in a small dog.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Wilson at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
