This is Go Bon Justfor U, born 4-09-2006. Bon is a beautiful blue brindle male. He's a fun dog who sometimes has a lot of energy to burn off, although in the house he likes to just hang out and kennels well. He is small animal safe and is doing well with other greyhounds too. Bon is mastering the stairs and is interested in what is going on around him - he is a real sweetheart! Bon could be a great dog for somebody who wants a jogging companion or likes to take long walks!

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
