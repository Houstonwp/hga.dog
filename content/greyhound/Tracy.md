Tracy is a petite five year old female who has a lot of personality and charm.  She is very affectionate and loves to nuzzle her nose into a person's neck or cuddle.  She also loves to play.  She plays with passion and is an excellent fetcher.  Her favorite toys are tennis balls and squeaker stuffed animals.  Tracy is perpetually happy and her tail will start wagging when someone simply looks and smiles at her or says her name.  Tracy is doing great living with three other greyhounds, but is not small dog or cat safe.  Tracy is fully house-trained and has had no problem being left unkenneled when her foster family is gone during the day.  


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Tracy at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
