Say hello to Ann.  She just came off the track on 1/2/10 and she is not yet 3 years old.  Ann is currently living in Omaha with 3 other greyhounds, a schnauzer and a toddler.  She is very sweet and is ready to find her forever home!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Ann at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
