Introducing Sylvester (Iwa Sylvester) he's a big 4-year-old boy who weight 80lbs, but don't let that fool you; he's a gentle giant.

Sylvester is getting along well with the small dog and other greyhounds in his foster home. He's a playful boy, who wants the other dogs to play with him. He is afraid of the cat.

He's doing well with stairs and rides very nicely in the car. 

Sylvester retired on 12-4-15. More information to come as we get to know him.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
