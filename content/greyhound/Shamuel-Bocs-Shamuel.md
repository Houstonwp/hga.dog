Meet Shamuel (Boc's Shamuel) a lovely 3-year-old boy with a shiny black coat, and a handsome face.

Shamuel is an easygoing boy who retired on 12-4-15. He was a good boy when given a bath, and relaxed so much in the tub he ended up just sitting for the bath. He rides well in the car, and loves people.

Shamuel did very well on his cat test. After a sniff to satisfy his curiosity, tail wagging the whole time, he was off to explore the rest of the house then onto the floor for a good nap.

We will have more pictures and information soon.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
