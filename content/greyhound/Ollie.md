Who Didit Olie or now just Ollie for short is a wonderfully mannered fawn male who will turn three in October.  Ollie is getting along just fine with three other greyhounds and a miniature schnauzer.  We have determined though that Ollie would prefer not to live with cats.  Ollie kennels well, sleeps right through the night and has had no accidents in the house.  He can do stairs and loves to go for walks.  He would make a very easy transition into your family!  Ollie is currently living in Omaha, NE and would love to meet you.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Ollie at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
