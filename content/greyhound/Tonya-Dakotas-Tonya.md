My name is Tonya (Dakotas Tonya).  I will turn 4 March 17th. I only weigh 56 pounds, but am like greased lightning.  Yes, I am a retired racer.  Let me tell you, did I race!  I ran 127 of  them, won  16 times, and finished in the money another 32!  Now that Iâm retired, my favorite activity is deciding which bed (on the floor) looks softest.  I like to sleep in my kennel, door opened or closed.  I get along with the other 3 dogs (two large and one small) in my foster home, and keep a safe distance from the mean cat.

I like to give kisses, especially to children.  I am short, so theyâre easier to reach.  I have even been known to give hugs.  I have just started learning how to play with toys, and I hoard my favorites in my kennel.

 Won't I make the perfect Christmas addition to your family? (Tonya is being fostered in the Omaha area)

This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
