Wild Fire is a black male who will be 2 years old in August.   He knows his name and answers to both "Wilder" and "Wild Fire," although at the moment he will just look at you when you call him.  He is cat and small dog correctable.   Wild Fire is currently living with another greyhound, a small dog, and cats.  So far he seems to be somewhat reserved.  His foster mom says he is content to laze around with her 6 year old greyhound so he seems to be adapting well to the retired life.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Wild Fire at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
