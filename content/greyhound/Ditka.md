Here is Ditka, known as Boc's Mike Dikta at the track.  Dikta is a great boy!  He is four years old, white and black,with what looks like a mask on his face.  Dikta is good with cats and small animals, is doing steps well, and is learning the ropes of life off the track â he walks carefully on the wood floors!  He is quiet when he has to be in the kennel, eats well, and is very well behaved.  He seems pretty laid back.  Dikta sleeps through the night and he has not had an accident in or out of the kennel.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
