Gable Karen - 6 years old (11/12/10) and just in to HGA on 1/2/17. Karen does not act her age and likes to jump fences, so her adopter will need to either have a 6 ft privacy fence or commit to leash-walking only. Karen is not small-animal safe!

Winter weather updates for meet & greets and other events: In case of inclement winter weather, check the Heartland Greyhound Adoption Facebook page for last-minute updates. Or follow us on Facebook and have those updates delivered to your newsfeed!
If you would like to meet this dog, please e-mail HGA at HeartlandGreyhound@outlook.com or call 515-967-6564 (please leave a message) and we will get back to you as soon as possible with more information. The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
