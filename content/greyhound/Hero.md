Hero is a sweet 2 year old boy who is calm around the house, but enjoys playing a game of backyard tag with the kids when he can.  Hero loves to be outdoors!  He often sniffs around the yard before finding a nice sunny spot to take a nap!  He's still getting used to the idea of "toys" but does seem to enjoy balls.  He'll go get the ball but hasn't learned to bring it back;  he'll just run around with it in his mouth.  In addition to his striking red brindle coat he also has the whitest teeth and sometimes you can catch him smiling when he's asleep.  He kennels well and has not had any accidents in the house.  He has tested OK with both small dogs and cats.  He does have a pulled tendon, so he favors that leg, but otherwise it doesn't seem to affect his walking and running.  He comes when he is called and has learned the command "wait" for opening sliding glass doors.  Hero is an old pro at stairs now, he is able to hop in and out of a SUV without any help, and his pulled tendon doesn't seem to slow him down at all!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Hero at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
