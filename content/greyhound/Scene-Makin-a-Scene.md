This is Scene (Makin a Scene)! He is fresh off the track (March 2015) and gorgeous! He will be 4 years old in April and is probably not small animal safe. More to come!

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
