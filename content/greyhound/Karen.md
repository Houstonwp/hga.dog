Meet Barts Kashi - better known as Karen.  She is only a year and a half old.  Karen just came off the track on Labor Day and she seems pretty reserved for such a young dog.  She tested well with a small dog, she is good on leash and loves to go for walks!


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Karen at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
