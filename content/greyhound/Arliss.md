Hereâs Arliss!  His racing name was TRUESTORYIMADEUP and he was born on 10-09-2007.  He is a beautiful fawn with a black muzzle.  Arliss tested okay with the cats and a small dog, heâs doing stairs well, and is living with another greyhound.  He just came off the track in late May so we donât know too much more about him yet.
 

  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Arliss at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
