This is Johnny, aka All on the Line. He is almost 5 yrs old (born Sept. 2007) and a very nice boy. He has a bit of a limp due to a broken leg that didn't heal quite properly. He probably wouldn't be a good running companion, but otherwise it doesn't bother him. Johnny kennels well, walks nicely on leash, and is OK with cats. Sometimes his tongue flops out the side of his mouth, and he chatters his teeth when he's happy or excited! Johnny is a little bit touchy about his space so would do best in a quieter home.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Johnny at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
