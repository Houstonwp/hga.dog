Here's Mastermind (JT Master Mind) a very mellow and friendly three-year-old boy. this handsome fellow adores attention, and is very well-mannered.

Mastermind is doing well with the other greyhound and the cats in his foster home. He sleeps through the night, and walks well on leash. He's food motivated, so basic obedience training should be a breeze. He his a snuggler who is settling for putting his head in peoples laps when he would really like to climb up on the couch with them (not allowed as a foster). Mastermind loves toys, especially squeakers, and hoards all his foster-brother's toys.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
