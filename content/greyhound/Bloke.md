Introducing Bloke! He is 5 years old - a big (69 lbs) white boy with brindle spots and ticking on his back and legs! Bloke is a very well behaved in and outside of the house - when he is inside he is almost always sleeping or eating. his two favorite things to do! Bloke loves kids. He lives with kids ages 7, 11, and 13 and does great! He enjoys the kids the best when they are calm and quiet in the house. Bloke goes for a walk almost every day and behaves well on leash. He really enjoys getting out for a stroll - he is content walking in front of you, or beside you. Bloke does not live with any dogs or cats, but plays nicely with a neighborâs standard poodle. He is not cat safe. Bloke is house trained, has never had an accident inside, and when he is outside he does not mark. He plays nicely in a yard with a four foot chain link. Bloke does not get up on furniture, couches, or beds. He is only lays on his big fluffy bed. Bloke is a pro at climbing up and down the stairs, and he walks wonderfully on slick hardwood floors. Bloke would make a great fit for any family, as long as they remember he can be shy until he warms up to his home and family members. Bloke is a great dog and would really like to have a home of his own!

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
