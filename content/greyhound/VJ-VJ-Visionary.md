This is VJ (VJ Visionary). He is a 3 year old male.  He has adapted very well to his foster home.  He mastered the stairs the first day home. He is housebroken and crates easily.  He loves going on walks.  He's very intrigued by everything around him.  He is a fun walking companion, and as you can see is a sitter!

In the house, he's always carrying one of his stuffed animals around.  He loves to play ball and tug of war with the kids.  He is great with kids, but is not small animal safe.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
