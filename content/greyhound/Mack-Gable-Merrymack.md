Mack, who was known as Gable Merrymack on the track, is a sweet three year old boy.  He is a big boy at 90 pounds and could probably stand to gain at least another five pounds.  However, his size makes him the perfect petting height when standing.  Mack is extremely affectionate and loves to be petted and talked to.  He will rest his head on someone's lap to encourage attention.  Mack is also a very calm boy whose favorite pastime is to sleep and lay close to where you are.  Mack lives with two other greyhounds currently, but would do well as an only dog.  Mack is protective of his food and needs to be separated from other dogs when eating.  This will likely improve as he learns food is plentiful in retirement.  Mack is currently wearing a cast for a pulled muscle on his hack.  Once removed, he will make someone an excellent walking or jogging companion.  Mack is not cat safe. 


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Mack at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
