Say hello to Annabelle (Happys Gluttony), a 7 year old brood mama.

Annabelle is very sweet and affectionate. She loves people, and wants to climb into laps for affection. She rides nicely in the car, and walks beautifully on leash.

Her cat test went very well, she was a little scared of the kitty. 

Stay tuned for updates as we get to know her better! (6/12/17)

If you would like to meet this dog, please e-mail HGA at HeartlandGreyhound@outlook.com or call 515-967-6564 (please leave a message) and we will get back to you as soon as possible with more information. The adoption fee for senior greyhounds age 7 and older  through HGA is $200. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
