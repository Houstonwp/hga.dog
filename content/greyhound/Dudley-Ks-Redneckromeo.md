Dudley (K's Redneckromeo) is a handsome three-year-old boy. He's a lover who was a favorite at the kennel, and will give hugs. 

Dudley is great on leash, in the car, does stairs easily, and likes his crate. He loves romping in the yard with his toys, and snoozing on the couch. He's food motivated, so should be a good candidate for training.  He's happier when he gets plenty of exercise. Good long walks, or play sessions are generally enough. 

Dudley prefers to be left alone when he's resting on his bed.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
