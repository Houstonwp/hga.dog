Maggie (Gil's Magnolia) is a pretty, petite girl who will be 2 yrs old in June.  She is very sweet and seems kind of quiet.  Maggie's foster family reports she is doing well in the house and is already going up and down stairs.  She walks nicely on leash.  She is OK with cats.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Maggie at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
