Meet WW's Headset - better known as Clay.  He is a red fawn with a beautiful black muzzle.  His date of birth is 9-1-2007, which makes him about 4 1/2 years old. Clay has been a quick learner, doing stairs as if he has always known them, kennels well, no accidents in the kennel or home, is a happy boy that is not shy but at the same time not confident....He has a great personality!  He loves his ears stratched and will groan when you are rubbing them!  He has lived with an Itailian Greyhound and a whippet and has paid no attention to the kitties.  Wow, if you are looking for that perfect greyhound look no further!!


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Clay at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
