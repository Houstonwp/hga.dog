Sweet little Amanda is to die for. She is around 3 years old and so intelligent and willing to please. She already knows just how to wiggle into your heart by smiling her way in and getting what she wants. She has a bum leg just out of a cast that she is willing to use as a crutch to get her some attention. She is healing well. It will most likely always have a limp but is a long way from her heart and she uses it just fine. She can already sit and heel and is very willing and eager to learn. She is house trained and seems to get along well with other dogs in the house but is a bit protective of herself and can be a bit of a diva. She loves her walks and is the first for cuddle time. She is a little shy at first but warms up in no time.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Amanda at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
