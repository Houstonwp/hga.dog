Allegro is a great and very large boy! He is potty-trained, kennels well and for extended periods of time, is good with our cat and small dog as well as the other greyhound in the home. Allegro does well on the leash though he will sometimes pull since he is interested in everything! Allegro had surgery on his back leg in October from an injury on the track but has recovered extremely well. He loves toys and bones and is full of energy- he loves to sprint around the back yard any chance he gets now that his leg is all healed.  He is very affectionate and loves to be the center of attention.  Allegro would likely do best in a home with other dogs as he does tend to get vocal when left all alone.  Allegro is being fostered in the Des Moines area.

This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
