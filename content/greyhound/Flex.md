Introducing Flex!  Flex is a nice black and white male, 3 years old.  He is learning stairs and kennels well.  He is a quiet boy in the kennel and is happy to be learning to live in a home.  He seems to be good with small dogs, we are still testing him with the kitty.  We will have more updates soon!

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
