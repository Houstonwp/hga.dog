Ira is a great guy who you will fall in love with. He has personality plus. Ira was born in April 2008 which makes him 5 1/2. HeÂ is very playful and loves the dog toys in his fosterâs home. He has a spring in his step and it is fun to watch him as he tries toÂ get you to play. Ira gets excited when you arrive home usually greeting with a bark and a little dance until you acknowledge him.Â He walks very well on leash and loves to run and explore the fenced-in backyard. Ira is extremely attentive, keeping his eye outÂ the window to watch the goings and comings in the neighborhood. He will stand and stare into a tree for ten minutes watching aÂ squirrel that he chased up it. Ira is very affectionate and will follow you around, curious as to what you are doing. He is catÂ and small animal safe. He is also good with children. Ira does not like to be kenneled or left alone by himself. Â The ideal homeÂ for Ira would be one where there is another dog especially another greyhound. Â He would also be good in a home where someone isÂ home much of the day. Â Donât miss this opportunity to adopt a wonderful pet.

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Ira at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 ($10.99 if registered through a website or phone # at the time of adoption) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
