Gator is a 2 yr old boy who is doing well with his transition to the retired life! He is house trained - his foster family says he has never had an accident in the house, does not mark, and is good about indicating when he needs to go outside. He loves being with his people and gets along well with their other greyhound.Gator loves to go for walks and will sometimes carry a favorite toy along! He does seem to have a fairly strong prey drive and may do best in a home without cats or other small animals.

If you would like to meet this dog, please e-mail HGA at HeartlandGreyhound@outlook.com or call 515-967-6564 (please leave a message) and we will get back to you as soon as possible with more information.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
