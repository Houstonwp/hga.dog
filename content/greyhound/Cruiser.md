Cruiser is a laid back greyhound enjoying every second of retirement.  He is curious and will investigate everything in his surroundings.  He is comfortable walking on carpet, linoleum, concrete, wooden decks, and grass.  Cruiser walks well on the leash and knows that business is to be done outside in the grass.  Barking dogs confuse and startle him, though he is unfazed by other dogs, in general.  When he is not lounging on his comforter, he likes to look out windows.  Fully closed mini blinds frustrate him, though he understands and responds to a firm "no".  He does not counter surf or get into trash, but he will stick his head into an open fridge to investigate.  Mooching and begging for people food is foreign to him, so meal prep and eating is a breeze.  When other people approach him he wags his tail and wants to be petted indefinitely. He is not needy and prefers to sleep on his bed, but when you do enter the room he will often greet you with a hearty thump of the tail and roll to his back for a belly rub.   


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Cruiser at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning.  HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID.  The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping.  Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
