Hello world. I am Outta Here, and I am a 3 year old male.  I am a quick learner and enjoy doing stairs, going for walks, and riding in the car.
 
I like doggie beds but prefer to sleep in the kennel.   I will wander if the door isnât closed. I also stay in the kennel during the day when no one is home.
I live with 2 other greyhounds, a Shiba Inu, and a cat.  The cat sometimes tries to box me, but I just pretend heâs not there.
I like to follow my brother around, and he showed me his secret stash of grazing grass. 

In the weeks since I retired I have decided I like toys, especially teddy bears.  I will carry them around & try to take them outside if you let me.

I am a great eater & always clean my bowl.  I am not treat motivated, but I am learning to like more things, like marshmallows.

I really like attention, and getting hugs is my favorite.  I am very trusting & will let you sleep with me if you want.
 

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
