Here is Hilltex Turbo, born 4-22-09.  Turbo just turned two and is off the track and ready for retirement.  He is living with a cat and another greyhound.  He has beautiful markings, almost a salt and pepper look.  Turbo is a calm boy who is learning life off the track.  We will update his bio when we have more information on this great boy.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Turbo at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $24.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
