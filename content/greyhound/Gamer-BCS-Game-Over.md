Gamer is just over a year old, but has a form of osteoarthritis in both elbows which will probably need to be managed (supplements and/or pain medication) for the rest of his life. Gamer is able to voluntarily go up and down stairs. And he is currently walking an average of 3 miles per day, where he loves to visit with his ever growing circle of neighborhood biped and quadruped friends.  He currently has free range of the house, has never pooed in the house.  And is only crated when foster parents are out of the house.  At night he sleeps on a floor pad in the master bedroom.  He loves carrying his prizes from the toy box in the kitchen to one of his sleeping pads and then watch his foster parents return the toys to the toy box.  Gamer's personal version of REVERSE FETCH! Gamer is not cat safe!

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
