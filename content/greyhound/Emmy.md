Emmy (Serena's Emmy) is a tiny girl weighing in at only 49 lbs.  She is very sweet and tested okay with small animals.  She is currently living with other greyhounds.  Emmy loves attention and will ask for a pet whenever she has a chance.  She will be 2 years old in March.


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Emmy at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure she is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
