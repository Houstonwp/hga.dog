Remi (No Contest) is a sweet, gentle little girl who just turned two.  She loves to play with other dogs, people, and especially with toys. She really likes empty milk jugs, or anything that makes a nice crinkling sound. She is super snuggly, and loves to be held. She will also jump up for a hug if you let her.

Remi sleeps through the night with ease. She had been in a home for a few months, so she will sneak up on the bed in the middle of the night. She has been polite about space sharing. Remi learned to use the doggy door on day one, and hasnât had an accident since. 

This little girl is very curious. She will poke her face into any cabinet you open, and generally takes a couple tours of a new room before she settles in.  She is very smart, and has learned âcomeâ and to âwaitâ before meals. Praise works better for her than treats for obedience training, because treats are too distracting.
Remi walks very nicely on a leash, and she loves running in the yard. She is great with stairs and is not bothered by slick floors. Sheâs fine with having her nails trimmed and her teeth brushed.

She is improving with her crate training and alone training. She will need some patience with this when she comes into a new situation, and may backslide for a bit. She would prefer to be in a home with a family where someone is home much of the time. In every other way weâve seen she is confident and outgoing, she just doesnât like her family to leave her. Weâre working on building her tolerance, and sheâs still pretty young, so we have high hopes for her ability to learn to cope with her family leaving sometimes. The presence or absence of other dogs makes no difference in this regard.

She has lived with cats, dogs, and children (4-8yrs).

If you are traveling from out of the area to meet this dog at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure s/he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $275. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
