Hereâs Earl! Earl is a handsome brindle who just turned 5. He's a very friendly dog and loves to be petted.  He's very fond of his bed and naps and has never been any trouble.  Earl lives with another greyhound and is finally learning to have fun playing chasing games. He does stairs and responds well to his name, and his coat has become very sleek and shiny. Earl would make a great addition to any home. Earl may do better with older children and will need to be carefully introduced to any cats in the family.


If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Earl at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $16.99 which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
