Here is Todd. He is a high energy for a greyhound, 4 yr old boy that is full of love. He enjoys walks, jogs, and playtime runs in a fenced yard. He is NOT cat safe. He gets along fine with other dogs and all people he meets. He does well on slippery floors and steps are no issue for this boy. Loves to ride in the car and travels very well. Todd has learned his manners well as far as house training & not counter surfing. He is ready for an active family. Todd is not safe with medium to small dogs or cats, and any children in the home should be older.Â 
If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Todd at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. HGA also microchips every greyhound prior to adoption as a permanent form of ID. The additional cost for this service is $17.99 ($10.99 if you register at the time of adoption through the Petfinder website or phone number) which covers the chip, activation, and membership and is a substantial savings over the usual cost for microchipping. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
