Arty is a happy, affectionate 3 1/2 year old boy. He is a smaller male, weighing just 65 pounds but believes he's a "big dog" and likes to be in charge.
He enjoys playing with toys and is quite rambunctious. Arty gets along with people of all ages, but all that energy he displays might be overwhelming for smaller children.   He gets along great with the teenagers in his foster home.  
Arty is what we call a velcro dog and follows his foster mom everywhere. Arty will make a good companion and would be a good "only" dog.
Arty is living with 2 greys and a cat and is cat-correctable. 


  If you are traveling from out of the area to meet Arty at an event, please e-mail Jorene at joreneross@aol.com or call 515-967-6564 and we will do our best to make sure he is present.

The adoption fee for greyhounds through HGA is $250. This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sighthound collar and leash set and muzzle. There is a $10 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
