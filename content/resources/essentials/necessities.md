Those considering adopting a retired greyhound can buy supplies in advance to help their grey feel right at home. HGA recommends having the following prior to adopting your greyhound.

### Crate ###
Racers spend most of their time at the track in a kennel crate and it can be a comfort to them as they transition to their new home. Acrate should be used for the adjustment period and sleeping, but can be phased out over time. The crate needs to be large enough for your dog to stand up, with its head up, and turn around. Put a washable blanket, a pillow, and a favorite toy in the crate to help your dog feel comfortable.

### Bed ###
Greyhounds are sleek, slender dogs that need a soft bed to rest comfortably. Greyhounds are big dogs, so buy a dog bed at least 30x30.

### Food ###
Purchase a premium food such as ProPlan, Nutro, IAMS, or Eukanube. If your grey has been at a foster home, check to see what it has been fed there. Cheap brands of dog food contain cor and wheat products that tend to give greyhounds gas and allergies.

### Food Container ###
It is a good idea to buy a garbage can or large, plastic container with a lid to store your dog's food. A tight-fitting lid will prevent your dog from gaining surprise access to its food.

### Elevated Food and Water Dishes ###
Plastic or metal stands can be purchased to raise up greyhounds' food and water bowls. Elevated bowls are recommended to prevent digestive upset, bloat, and choking in greyhounds. Metal bowls with a wide bottom are suggested. (Clay bowls may contain lead or cause and allergic reaction in your dog, and plastic bowls also can cause allergies).

### Sighthound Collar and Leash ###
Greyhounds have small heads and can easily slip out of regular collars, regardless of how tightly they are fitted. Special nylon sighthound collars and leashes are provided with each retired racer adopted through Heartland Greyhound Adoption.

### Toys ###
Good dog toys include Nylabones, Gumabones, hard rubber balls, tennis balls, soft fleece toys and large Kong toys. Make sure that the toy is sturdily made and not too small, or your grey could choke on it.

### Treats ###
Greyhounds love treats and some will need them to put on  weight. Dog biscuits and patties are common treats, but you also can give your grey small quantities of vegetables, marshmallows, peanut butter, cheese, rice, and fruit.

### Grooming Brush ###
A soft rubber brush will do nicely, not a metal brush with hard teeth. Greyhounds are lean dogs with thin coats and a metal brush is too harsh for them.

### Dog Toothbrush and Toothpaste ###
Brushing your dogs teeth helps prevent tarter build-up. Doggie toothbrushes and toothpaste are available from your veterinarian or pet store. Do not use human toothpaste.
