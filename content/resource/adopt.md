### How to Adopt ###

This fee pays for medical costs including spay/neuter surgery, shots, parasite treatments, and teeth cleaning. Each dog also comes with a special sight hound collar and , leash set and muzzle. Those who adopt greyhounds through HGA get a one-year membership in the group. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee that is applied to an approved adoption.
