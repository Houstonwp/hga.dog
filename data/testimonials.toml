    quote = "&ldquo;There are many wonderful greyhound adoption groups, but for me, Heartland stands just a little bit taller mainly because of all the good foster work they do to make sure that whenever a hound is placed permanently with a family, that dog will likely have found their &ldquo;forever&rdquo; home. Kudos!&rdquo;"
